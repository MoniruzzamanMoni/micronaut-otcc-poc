               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The law provides several rules for the valuation of inventory. In general, they are based on the market cost at the end of the year.</p>
               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Merchandise for resale, raw materials and materials are valued at the cost of the last purchase made during the 2 months preceding the close of the tax year. If no purchase was made during those 2 months, the cost of the last purchase made in the tax year, if any, is used. If no purchases were made during the tax year, the value registered for fiscal purposes in the opening inventory must be considered.</p>
               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Manufactured products are valued at the price of the last sale made during the 2 months preceding the end of the tax year, as reduced by sale expenses and the net profit margin included in such a price. If no sales are made during those 2 months, the price of the last sale during the tax year (if any) is used, as reduced by sale expenses and the net profit margin. If no sale is made during the tax year, the last sale price of the tax year must be considered, reduced by sale expenses and the net profit margin.</p>
               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">If the taxpayer maintains a system that allows for the determination of the production cost of each set of manufactured products, then the method established for the valuation of inventory of merchandise for resale must be used for the valuation of products, treating the end of the manufacturing period as the purchase date. In these cases the allocation of raw materials and materials to processing is made in light of the method established for the valuation of inventory of such goods.</p>
               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Unfinished products are valued by applying the percentage of completion at the end of the tax year to the value established under the above rules.</p>
               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">If the taxpayer can duly substantiate that the market cost at the end of the tax period is less than the value established under the foregoing rules, inventory may be valued at market cost. In this case, it is necessary to report the method used to the tax administration when filing the income tax return.</p>

Due to exchange control measures, access to foreign currency at the “official” rate is restricted. Thus, businesses have opted to obtain foreign currency through alternative mechanisms that are legal transactions, such as buying government bonds in <xref target="cta_ar_2022-04-15_abb_ars" publish="y">ARS</xref> and selling them for USD, but may result in higher exchange rates. The tax administration (<emph type="i">Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos</emph>, <xref target="cta_ar_2022-04-15_abb_afip" publish="y">AFIP</xref>) has deemed those transactions to be harmful practices aimed at creating fictitious losses, and has thus disallowed them. However, the circular certainly creates controversy with respect to transactions that are performed for legitimate business purposes and that meet the requirements to produce “necessary” expenses, which are nevertheless disregarded. </p>

                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Law 27,640 established the new framework regime for the development of Biofuels, replacing the former regime established by Law 26,334. The regime established by Law 27,640 is applicable until 31 December 2030 and may be extended by the Executive Branch for 5 additional years.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Biofuel is defined as biodiesel and bioethanol produced in Argentina from organic raw materials (e.g. from agricultural, agro-industrial and organic waste) that meet the quality standards established by the Secretariat of Energy, which is a department of the Ministry of Economy. The Secretariat of Energy is the authority in charge of the application of the new regulatory framework for biofuels.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">From a tax incentive standpoint, the relevant measure is the exemption of biodiesel and bioethanol from the tax on liquid fuels and from the tax on carbon dioxide that are established by Law 23,966 (title III, chapters I and II, respectively). The exemptions apply from 5 August 2021 to 31 December 2030.</p>

                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">At present, almost all provinces have established provincial promotion regimes, granting tax benefits and incentives for various activities. Furthermore, the provinces of San Luis, Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mendoza, La Pampa, Chubut, Misiones, Tucumán and Salta have created free-trade zones.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Free-trade zones allow exporters to import the necessary equipment to build a “turnkey operation” within such zone free of customs duties, statistical fees and VAT. Furthermore, exporters manufacturing within the free-trade zone may buy supplies and raw materials from third countries without having to pay duties.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">By exporting through a free-trade zone, companies are not only exempt from all export duties but also enjoy other incentives at the national level. In addition, companies operating in a free-trade zone may face lower production costs due to the VAT exemption and lower internal taxes on utilities such as electricity, gas, water and telecommunications.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">In the province of San Luis, the free-trade zone of Justo Daract allows a different treatment of investments, goods, operative expenses and provision of goods and services. In this free-trade zone, the following activities are allowed:</p>

Regarding tax incentives, the province exempts basic services supplied in such free-trade zones from taxes and/or contributions, such as electricity, telecommunications, gas and water.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The free-trade zone of Córdoba (Zofracor) is located in the municipality of Juárez Celman.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The free-trade zone of Mendoza is situated in the Provincial Industrial Park. As it is a free-trade zone, goods, products and raw materials may enter and remain in such territory without giving rise to any import or export duties. Storage, commercial and industrial activities may be carried out. Regarding industrial activities, raw materials coming from a foreign country may be entered without having to pay any taxes. If they come from the national territory, they may enter without having to pay the VAT levied on their purchase. Moreover, public services used in such free zone are not subject to federal or local (provincial) taxes.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">A special tax and customs regime is established in the province of Tierra del Fuego. Such special regime exempts individuals and legal entities carrying out activities or transactions in such jurisdiction from some federal taxes levied on activities or transactions, with certain limits. Tax benefits comprise: (1) relief of income tax; (2) exemption from VAT; (3) relief of taxes on capital; (4) exemption from stamp duties; (5) exemption from import duties and VAT for capital assets; (6) additional reimbursement for exports; and (7) exemption from import duties over raw materials.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">After the enactment of Decree 751/2012, this regime is no longer applicable to those activities related to the production of oil and gas, including extraction, related services (except prospecting activities) and geological services. This regime also applies to individuals and legal persons involved in the export of such products.</p>

                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Law 27,430, published in the Official Gazette of 29 December 2017, created a regime to restate the value of assets used to generate taxable income.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The regime, which is optional, allows for the update of the value of generally, but not exclusively, depreciable assets that were eroded by years of inflation without an adjustment for inflation. The increased tax basis requires the payment of a special tax.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The regime is applicable to individuals and companies in connection with assets located in Argentina that are used to generate income and capital gains that are taxable under the <xref target="cta_ar_2022-04-15_abb_liag" publish="y">LIAG</xref>. The option for the regime must be exercised at the first fiscal year closed after Law 27,430 was published – in practice, fiscal years ending from 31 December 2017 onwards. Eligible assets are depreciable assets in general including immovable property, mines, quarries, forestry, intangible assets, shares and other forms of participation in the capital of companies. Merchandise is excluded, while immovable property classified as inventory is eligible. Assets subject to accelerated depreciation are excluded, as well as assets disclosed under the amnesty regime established by Law 27,260 and assets without residual value at the time to exercise the option.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The restatement of value is determined by multiplying the acquisition or construction value of the assets by a factor reflecting the inflation rate between the incorporation of the asset and the end of the fiscal year where the option is exercised. The amount of the restatement (<emph type="i">Importe del Revalúo</emph>) is the difference between the restated residual value of each asset and the residual value of that asset in accordance with LIAG provisions.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The restatement of the residual value of the assets determines a new tax basis for future depreciation purposes. The amount of the restatement is subject to a special tax at the following rates:</p>

                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Law 27,613 established a regime to promote private building construction and to facilitate the access to housing through the granting of tax incentives and an amnesty regime for unreported cash placed offshore or onshore, which applies provided that the cash is used for financing the promoted investments.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The main features of the regime are the following: </p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">An eligible building project is a new private building construction (including improvements, expansions and installations, provided that the work is subject to approval by a competent authority in accordance with the applicable building code) started as from 12 March 2021. Nonetheless, works started before that date, but for which the progress is below 50% of the total project are also included in the regime.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Investment made in building construction projects is exempt from personal assets tax until 31 December 2022. The maximum duration of the benefit is 2 tax years, which may be shorter if the project is finished or sold before (whichever happens first).</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Additionally, an amount equivalent to 1% of the investment made in building construction projects may be computed as an advance payment of the personal assets tax. Such advance payments offset tax liabilities of the taxpayer (other than that related to the promoted investment, which is exempt) and may be carried forward until tax year 2022 in case there is no tax liability to offset.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The regime also provides the deferral of payment of the tax on the transfer of immovable property or income tax (generally, the transfer of immovable property is subject to income tax or to the tax on the transfer of immovable property, depending on when the property was acquired).</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The deferral applies in respect of projects developed within the time frame mentioned above and the measure is aimed at individuals that transfer land to developers but who must wait until the project is finished or sold to receive a consideration.

               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The General Director of the tax authorities is responsible for interpreting the laws and decrees regarding taxes under its jurisdiction where the taxpayer’s general interest is involved. Such interpretations, made by means of public rulings, are published in the Official Gazette and are binding on both the tax administration and taxpayers. Taxpayers may appeal decisions of the tax authorities to the Ministry of Economy within 10 days. Such an appeal does not release the taxpayer from the obligation to pay taxes on transactions deemed to be taxable during the ruling request procedure, but if the decision of the tax authorities is revoked by the Ministry of Economy, the taxpayer will be entitled to a tax refund.</p>

However, customs duties and advance pricing agreements that are regulated by article 217 of Law 11,683 are not covered by the rulings regime. In addition, the regime does not apply to questions regarding the application of income tax treaties.</p>
               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">General Resolution 4,497 expanded the scope of rulings to cover requests by a non-resident person or a resident person with non-resident related parties and to matters referring to tax incentives and reductions of the taxable base, transfer pricing or permanent establishment situations. For this purpose, a related-party threshold of at least 25% participation in the capital or voting rights is established. General Resolution 4,497 also allows the exchange of rulings with foreign tax administrations.</p>

For estimation purposes, use may be made of general averages or coefficients established by the General Director for the same kind of activity.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The tax administration may also estimate the amount of sales, services or profits by using other indexes (e.g. consumption of gas and electricity, purchase of raw material and containers, payment of salaries, use of transportation, assets). The tax administration may use one or more indexes taken from the taxpayer’s previous tax years or from other persons engaging in similar activities.</p>

The solution includes a plan to re-allocate part of taxing rights over large and high profitable enterprises from their home countries to jurisdictions in which goods or services are supplied or consumers are located (market jurisdictions), regardless of whether these enterprises have a physical presence there (Pillar One). This new taxing right for market jurisdictions (the so-called Amount A) would affect multinational groups with global turnover above EUR 20 billion and profit before tax/revenue above 10%. Currently, draft model rules released by the OECD for nexus, revenue sourcing and tax base determination are under public consultation. </p>

                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Argentinian-source income is normally assessed under a notional taxable-income rule. However, there are some situations in which the non-resident taxpayer may pay tax on the actual taxable income or gains. This is the case in relation to, for instance, gains from the disposal of assets situated (e.g. real estate) or economically used (e.g. trademarks) in Argentina or rents from immovable property situated in Argentina.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The notional taxable income is a specific percentage of the gross payment to the non-resident. The percentage depends on the type of income. The effective withholding tax rate is determined by applying the general 35% withholding tax rate to the deemed taxable income. The general deemed taxable income rate (i.e. the residual rate for those cases not specifically foreseen) is 90% of the gross income, in which case the general effective withholding tax rate is 31.5% of the gross payment. For the purposes of this chapter, unless specifically provided otherwise, we refer to the effective tax rate as the withholding tax levied on a non-resident. The withholding tax is final.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Income from import transactions of tangible goods is treated as foreign-source income derived by a non-resident exporter; thus, no withholding tax applies in such cases. Income arising from sales of goods within Argentina after their import is deemed to be wholly Argentinian-source income, whether or not it is connected to a PE situated in Argentina, or to a trade or business carried on therein.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The transfer of goods situated, located or economically used in Argentina but belonging to enterprises or companies organized, established or located abroad is presumed to produce Argentinian-source taxable income representing 50% of the corresponding consideration. The taxpayer, however, may choose to be taxed on actual net income and deduct from gross income (i) expenses incurred in Argentina which are necessary to obtain, maintain or retain the income, and (ii) other deductions authorized by the law under ordinary rules.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Under the law, where comparable prices are available in transparent markets, these prices must be used. The prices may, however, be set in a different way, in which case the burden of proof lies with the taxpayer. If no transparent market between unrelated parties exists, a taxpayer has to provide all of the information required by the tax administration to prove an arm’s length price has been used.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Income from the export of goods produced, manufactured, processed or purchased within Argentina is deemed to be wholly Argentinian-source income. The remittance of such goods by an Argentinian subsidiary, branch or agent of a non-resident to another country (e.g. remittances by a PE to its head office) is also deemed to be an export. Taxable income is established by deducting from the sales price the cost of goods, freight and insurance expenses necessary for the transportation of the goods to their destination, commission fees and sale expenses, and expenses incurred in Argentina, in so far as they are necessary to obtain taxable income.</p>

Payments made to a head office are not only subject to the transfer pricing rules, but also to a particular rule which requires effective payment of the expenses in order for the PE to be able to deduct them for income tax purposes.</p>

Although this tax is payable by the local issuer of the shares, the law specifically foresees that it may be recovered from the non-resident shareholder by way of withholding or by foreclosing on the assets that gave rise to such payment. Therefore, even though the local issuer of the shares is the local taxpayer, given that the tax is actually levied on the non-resident shareholder, the latter has final responsibility for the payment of the tax.</p>

This is a final tax. There is no obligation to register with the tax authorities or to file any income tax return.</p>
               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">However, in certain limited cases (e.g. a sale of real estate in Argentina), a non-resident taxpayer may elect to pay income tax on the actual income.

               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Law 27,430 also introduced a procedure for advance pricing agreements (APAs) between the tax administration and the taxpayer in order to establish the transfer pricing methods used to determine the arm’s length price in future transactions between the taxpayer and related parties. The agreement is binding only to the taxpayer involved and the tax authority, but the results may eventually be exchanged with third countries under existing international conventions. Changes introduced by Law 27,430 are effective from January 2018.</p>

               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">As a rule, the transfer of assets that arises upon the merger or split of companies may generate an income tax or VAT liability. If the merger or division complies with the requirements of the <xref target="cta_ar_2022-04-15_abb_liag" publish="y">LIAG</xref> and regulations, it is considered a tax-free reorganization. In general terms this entails a deferral of the tax consequences because the receiving entity acquires the assets with the tax cost of the company being reorganized.</p>
               <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The benefits of a tax-free reorganization include the transfer of tax credits and accumulated net operating losses from one entity to another, and the transfer of the tax costs and amortization and depreciation methods of the assets. Thus, no income tax is triggered and there is no VAT on the transfer of assets which would normally be subject to this tax.</p>

The solution includes a plan to ensure that large multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each of the jurisdictions where they operate (Pillar Two). A key component of this plan is the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules, which provide for a co-ordinated system of taxation that imposes a top-up tax on profits arising in a jurisdiction whenever the effective tax rate is below the minimum rate of 15%. On 20 December 2021, the OECD released the GloBe model rules for domestic implementation while the implementation framework of the global minimum tax is currently under public consultation.</p>

               spacebelow="1">As a rule, interest on debt attributable to an income-generating activity is deductible. For this purpose, the term "interest" comprises also foreign exchange differences and the contractual adjustment of debt (upwards) due to inflation, provided the adjustment for inflation mechanism contained in the <xref target="cta_ar_2022-04-15_abb_liag" publish="y">LIAG</xref> is not triggered for the respective fiscal year. Adjustment for inflation applies in any given year when inflation exceeds certain threshold – <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_ar_2022-04-15_s_1.2.1." publish="y">1.2.1.</xref> </p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Article 50 of Law 27,430 amended article 85 of the LIAG to replace the former thin capitalization regime with a new limitation on the deduction of interest payments based on the EBITDA, applicable to interest accrued to fiscal years started as from 1 January 2018. Accordingly, Interest which deduction is subject to limitations is that accruing to “financial debt” (debt incurred to acquire assets or services related to the operation of the company is excluded) entered with related parties, whether resident or not. The deduction of those interests is limited to a yearly fixed amount of <xref target="cta_ar_2022-04-15_abb_ars" publish="y">ARS</xref> 1,000,000 (as provided by Decree 1170/2018) or 30% of EBITDA, whichever limit is higher.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The system contemplates a carry-back of 3 years and a carry-forward of 5 years to allocate interests that were not deductible when they accrued applying a "first in-first out" method. Additionally, the limitation regime does not apply to financial entities, certain financial trusts (<emph type="i">fideicomisos</emph>) and certain companies providing operative leasing. Alternatively, a company may avoid the limitation in the deduction of interest if it can demonstrate that the annual charge of interest related to financial debt as compared to its taxable income is within or below the ratio determined by the economic group to which the company in question belongs.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Further, interest may be deducted without limitations if the company incurring the debt can demonstrate that the beneficiary of the interest paid the corresponding income tax on those benefits.

            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Interest deduction may be limited also by case law interpreting legal provisions and eventually filling gaps in the LIAG as it is the case with the Federal Supreme Court’s decision in <emph type="i">INC S.A. c/ D.G.I</emph>. of 15 July 2021.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The key to the case is to what extent interest accrued on listed corporate debt bonds (<emph type="i">obligaciones negociables</emph>) issued by a company with the aim of financing the payment of bank loans concluded to acquire a supermarket chain through a debt pushdown scheme could be considered necessary or related with an income generating activity, and is thus deductible.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Neither the LIAG nor Law 23,576 on listed corporate debt bonds contain a provision addressing this type of acquisition structure. This was confirmed by the Tax Court, the Chamber of Appeals and even the Supreme Court’s advocate general which ruled in favour of the taxpayer in the absence of a specific limitation to interest deduction.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">In order to revert these decisions the Supreme Court referred to the general principle provided by article 83 (previously 80) of the LIAG, according to which deductible expenses are those incurred to obtain and maintain taxable income, and by article 85(a) (previously 81(a)), which provides specific rules for the deduction of interest (mentioned above). By interpreting these articles, the Court elaborated a point of view according to which it is possible to identify liabilities incurred by the taxpayer for a reason other than the generation of taxable income and deny the deduction of the respective interest. The case challenges the view that all financial liabilities finance the whole of assets and activities of a company and thus that interest accruing to that debt are automatically deductible.</p>

            <title align="left">Stamp duty</title>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Stamp duty is a local tax levied on contracts that are either signed or have effect in any of the Argentinian provinces or the Buenos Aires city jurisdiction. Given that this is a local tax, its rules are governed by provincial code or law.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The taxable base for the stamp duty is the economic value of the transaction as foreseen in each local rule. If no value clearly arises from the instrument itself, the parties must estimate such value upon payment; certain provinces even request that the value be indicated in the instrument itself.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The stamp duty is payable in the province in which the instrument is executed, but it may also be applicable in the province in which the transaction has effect. In the case of contracts executed abroad, the duty is sometimes triggered upon the time it has effect in the Argentinian territory. The rate varies between the provinces and also depending on the type of transaction (<emph type="i">see</emph> below).</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Transfers of immovable property are subject to stamp duties on the value of the property stated in the sales contract, or the cadastral value, whichever is greater. The amount of stamp duty paid on a previous promise to sell immovable property may be credited against the liability for the stamp duty on the final transfer of that property. The rate varies depending on the jurisdiction but, in accordance with the 2021 Federal Fiscal Agreement, tax rate must not exceed 3.5%.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">The provinces must include, in their corresponding laws, provisions for the avoidance of internal double taxation. In order to avoid double taxation, some provinces do not impose stamp duty on contracts documented in their jurisdiction which refer to goods located in another jurisdiction. Similarly, some provinces do not impose duty on contracts which have effect in their own jurisdiction and which have already been taxed by the province where they are documented.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">In the case of contracts that are instrumented by offer letters sent by one party to the other, the provincial rules normally provide that stamp duty is triggered when the letter is accepted by signing the offer or in the correspondence in which the proposal (or at least the relevant wording) is inserted in order to determine the object of the contract. This is related to the characteristic of an “instrumental” tax as foreseen in the Co-Participation System. Conflicts have arisen on the taxation of proposals that, for example, are accepted by an act. Case law from the Supreme Court has clarified in several decisions that this is not an instrument subject to tax.</p>
            <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">Transfers of shares are subject to stamp duty provided generally that the transfer is made by a written agreement. In accordance with the 2021 Federal Fiscal Agreement, the tax rate must not exceed 2% for this type of transactions. Additionally, jurisdictions may exempt certain transactions (e.g. transfer of listed shares). The same limitation of the tax rate applies to other transactions such as procurement and distribution contracts in accordance with the mentioned Federal Fiscal Agreement.</p>

As it is a local tax, each province and the city of Buenos Aires have their own rules.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">As a general rule, the tax is levied on gross receipts accruing during the tax period (i.e. the calendar year) and derived from the development of the activity subject to tax according to the law. In certain cases, special provisions provide for taxation on a cash basis (e.g. for taxpayers for whom bookkeeping is not compulsory). There are also instances where the tax is calculated on the difference between the purchasing and selling prices (e.g. certain fuel and tobacco products and fees for brokerage or intermediation activities). Special rules are also provided for the computation of the taxable base in certain cases, such as banks, insurance companies, foreign exchange, news agencies, etc. The jurisdictions are currently expanding situations that would qualify as digital presence or domicile in order to levy a tax on digital commerce.</p>
                  <p align="left" num_just="default" spaceabove="1" spacebelow="1">For legal purposes, the term “gross receipts” includes the proceeds from sales other than fixed assets, consideration for the rendering of services, consideration for the development of activities, interest on loans and financing, and proceeds from activities, whether in cash, kind or services.</p>
