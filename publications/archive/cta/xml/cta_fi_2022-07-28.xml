               <p>The geographical jurisdiction of Finnish tax legislation is defined in chapter 1 of the Income Tax Law (<emph type="i">Tuloverolaki</emph>; <emph type="i">Inkomstskattelagen</emph>; <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>). Generally, resident taxpayers are subject to tax on their global income and non-residents are taxed on income originating from Finland, if listed in sections 9 and 10 of the TVL.</p>
               <p>According to domestic law, Finland covers the mainland and the province of Åland. For national income tax purposes, the province of Åland is part of Finland, but it has the right to levy its own provincial and municipal taxes.</p>

               <title>Statutory framework</title>
               <p>The main income tax law for companies is the Business Income Tax Law (<emph type="i">Laki elinkeinotulon verottamisesta</emph>; <emph type="i">Lag om beskattning av inkomst av näringsverksamhet</emph>; <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). The net business income of all types of taxpayers is determined thereunder. If the Business Income Tax Law does not contain a relevant provision, then generally the Income Tax Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>) is applied. Both laws apply to companies and individuals. The Law on Tax Procedure (<emph type="i">Laki verotusmenettelystä</emph>/<emph type="i">Lag om beskattningsförfarande</emph>, <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>) and the Law on Tax Procedure for Self-Assessed Taxes (<emph type="i">Laki oma-aloitteisten verojen verotusmenettelystä</emph>/<emph type="i">Lag om beskattningförfarandet beträffande skatter som betalas på egen initiative</emph>, <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_oyl">OVML</xref>), which entered into force on 1 January 2017, contain important provisions on the arm’s length requirement, constructive dividends and tax avoidance, as well as provisions relating to assessment procedures. There is also a comprehensive body of tax laws and decrees.</p>
               <p>The tax administration (<emph type="i">Verohallinto</emph>) issues instructions on substantive matters, and these bind the tax authorities.</p>
               <p>The case law, and especially the precedents of the Supreme Administrative Court (KHO), are important for both the tax authorities and taxpayers. Both the Central Board of Taxation (KVL) and the Supreme Administrative Court publish advance rulings, which do not reveal the taxpayer’s identity, and which they consider to have precedential value.</p>

               <p>Finland applies the classical double tax system with some modifications. Dividends received by corporate shareholders are tax exempt with certain exceptions under the participation exemption as described in section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_6.">6.</xref> </p>

               <title>Definition of residence</title>
               <p>With effect from 1 January 2021, a definition of the concept of residence is introduced in tax legislation. Accordingly, a company is a Finnish resident if it is registered in Finland, incorporated in Finland or has its place of effective management in Finland (section 9 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref> and section 1 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_oyl_2">OYL</xref>). Such companies are liable to tax on their worldwide profits.</p>
               <p>Companies not included in the abovementioned definition are treated as tax non-residents. Such companies are liable to tax on income from the Finnish sources only, unless the domestic law or the relevant treaty prevents Finland from taxing their income.</p>
               <p>Before 2021, a company was in practice regarded as resident only if it was registered in Finland or incorporated under Finnish law.</p>

               <title>General</title>
               <p>In general, all income derived by companies is taxable. For exempt dividends and capital gains; <emph type="i">see</emph> sections <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_6.1.3.">6.1.3.</xref> and <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.7.5.">1.7.5.</xref>, respectively.</p>
               <p>The tax assessment is based on profit and loss calculation on the corporate tax return. In addition, the company must annex its audited financial statements (income statement and balance sheet) to its tax return.</p>
               <p>Income is generally computed on accrual basis. The tax laws require few adjustments. However, certain reserves for future expenses, which are required under commercial accounting principles, are usually not tax deductible.</p>
               <p>Conformity between accounting and taxation is required (section 54 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). To be tax deductible, the item must be recorded in the accounts and included in the profit and loss account.</p>
               <p>Resident companies are subject to tax on their worldwide income. Branches of non-resident companies are taxed on their Finnish-source income and on income attributable to the branch.</p>
               <p>A company can in principle have taxable income from three sources, i.e. business, other income, and farming. Worldwide income and expense items, including interest expense, must be allocated to the relevant category and the taxable profit or loss is attributed to a source. Loss carry-forwards may only be deducted from the taxable profits in the same source. The netting of a loss generated in another income category is not allowed against a business profit. The taxable profit for business income is determined according to Business Income Tax Law (EVL) and the taxable profit for other income according to Income Tax Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>).</p>
               <p>The concepts of business income and the related expense are wide. It is rare for companies to have income or expense which would be deemed as other income.</p>
               <p>In practice, the hiring-out of immovable property not needed for the business of the related companies could be treated as other income. Family-held companies may in practice be deemed to have such assets (long-term investments, deposits and immovable property for recreational purposes).</p>
               <p>With effect from 1 January 2020, the categories of income for resident companies which are listed in section 3 of the TVL (e.g. limited liability companies and cooperatives) were amended. From that date, all types of income generated by such companies from commercial activities have been treated as business income and taxed under the EVL, except for income from agriculture. Most resident companies have only one category of income. The amendments did not affect the relevant tax rules for, inter alia, housing associations, real estate companies and exempt entities. If the entity is not listed in section 3 of the TVL, its income continues to be taxed in all three income categories. </p>
               <p>If the company derives income from non-commercial activities in 2020 or later, that income generally falls under business income, but the related assets will fall under “other assets”.</p>
               <p>The Law on Group Contribution only concerns business income. A loss in another income category may not be netted against a group contribution by a related business company. In an unclear case, an advance ruling may be obtained.</p>
               <p>A taxpayer may use the completed contract method or the percentage of completion method in the accounting and tax treatment of long-term contracts. The percentage of completion method may be used if it takes more than 1 year to manufacture or construct the object (e.g. a ship or a building). Expenses must then be treated in the manner in which revenue is recorded. If the taxpayer chooses the percentage of completion method as its basis for accounting and taxation, every long-term contract must be treated in the same manner (section 19 of the EVL).</p>
               <p>Companies may elect to use the IFRS principles instead of local GAAP for accounting of separate group companies and to base their corporate tax return on the IFRS financial statements.

               <p>The tax year normally runs from 1 January to 31 December (section 3 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>). Companies whose accounting period is other than the calendar year are taxed on the accounting period or periods ending in the calendar year. Normally an accounting period covers 12 months, but when a business is started or terminated, or when the accounting period is changed, it may be shorter or longer (not more than 18 months).</p>
               <p>It is relatively simple to change the taxable period of a company and it may be done any number of times. The change must be reported to the tax office 2 months before the new accounting year ends if the accounting year is shortened. If the accounting year is extended, the change must be reported 2 months before the old accounting year would have ended. The taxpayer must have made all necessary amendments to the articles of association and registered the change in the trade register to benefit from the change.</p>
               <p>Taxes are levied in the 10-month assessment period, which usually ends by the end of October of the year following the tax year for calendar-year based companies. Advance taxes are normally paid in the tax year, i.e. during the accounting period of the company.</p>

               <p>If the taxpayer can prove that the net book value of a depreciable asset exceeds the market value of that asset, the taxpayer is allowed to deduct, for tax purposes, the additional depreciation which will reduce the net book value of the asset to the market value with effect from the end of the accounting year concerned. A similar additional depreciation for machinery and equipment is allowed if the taxpayer can prove that the total net book value of all machinery and equipment, due to a decrease in values, destruction or damage to property or other reason, exceeds the market value of the machinery and equipment. However, additional depreciation of the cost of construction, equipment, machinery and other assets for the prevention of water and air pollution is allowed only where there is actual damage to the asset (<emph type="i">see</emph> <emph type="i">also</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.5.4.">1.5.4.</xref>) (section 40 of the EVL).</p>
               <p>Goodwill, patents and other intangible assets are valued for tax purposes at their acquisition cost, reduced by any amortization deductions previously taken.

               <p>Depreciation for tax purposes is not allowed for fixed assets which are not subject to wear and tear, such as land, securities and participations in other companies and partnerships.</p>
               <p>Securities and participations are classified as fixed assets if they are intended to be used permanently in the business or profession (section 12 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>).

               <p>Non-depreciable assets are entered on the balance sheet at their direct acquisition cost increased by, for example, transfer taxes and lawyers’ fees. Any unrealized increases or decreases in value do not, in principle, affect taxable profits.</p>
               <p>If the fair market value of land, securities or participations is, with effect from the balance sheet date, permanently essentially higher than the purchase price, the difference may be included in the balance sheet as a separate revaluation item. To the extent the revaluation later proves to be excessive, it must be revoked (chapter 5, section 17 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_kpl">KPL</xref>). The recording or revocation of the revaluation is not a taxable event for companies other than banks and financial institutions.</p>
               <p>Any extraordinary depreciation deduction for fixed assets not subject to wear and tear, claimed under prior law, must be added back to the taxable income to the extent that the market value at the end of any future accounting year exceeds the net book value (section 5a(4) of the EVL).

In the case of financial, insurance and pension institutions, securities and participations, but not debt claims, are classified as investment assets if they have the nature of a long-term investment or investment security (section 11 of the EVL).

               <title>General principles</title>
               <p>As a general rule, deductions are allowed for all costs and expenses incurred by the business within the tax year for the purpose of earning, securing, or maintaining the taxpayer’s income (sections 7, 8, 17 and 18 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). Expenses are thus tax deductible under the accrual principle. Reserves for future expenses are generally not tax deductible.</p>
               <p>Payments to affiliates of amounts exceeding the arm’s length cost may be disallowed.</p>
               <p>Transaction costs (such as lawyers’ fees), transfer taxes and similar expenses, which must be capitalized in connection with the asset to which they relate or are assessed, are depreciable if the underlying asset is depreciable, such as buildings. If the asset, such as shares or other securities or land, is not subject to wear and tear, neither the acquisition price of the asset nor the expenses relating to the acquisition are deductible until disposal. Expenses relating to obtaining tax-exempt income are not tax deductible.</p>

               <title>Employees’ remuneration</title>
               <p>Salaries and wages paid to employees are generally deductible (section 8 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). There are no limits on payments to employees.</p>
               <p>Social security contributions relating to salaries and wages are tax deductible. Employers are entitled to deduct pension insurance premiums even if they would have been paid for private pension insurance schemes arranged by the employer. Private pension insurance schemes may in some cases be treated as salary income to employees and be taxed accordingly. The premiums are, however, tax deductible in any case. Obligatory pension insurance schemes may not be treated as salary income to the employees.</p>
               <p>Daily allowances and mileage compensation are tax deductible although, if not exceeding certain limits set by the tax authorities, they are tax-exempt income in the hands of the employees.</p>
               <p>Fringe benefits, such as housing and company car benefits, are taxable salary income in the hands of employees. All costs relating to the arrangement of these benefits are tax deductible to the employer.</p>
               <p>Conventional gifts to employees are tax deductible, but if they are valuable or given in cash, they are regarded as salary income to employees.</p>
               <p>If the employee is granted option rights or is allowed to buy or subscribe to the employer’s shares (or in the case of a foreign-owned subsidiary the foreign parent company’s shares), the employee receives a taxable benefit if the purchase or subscription price is lower than the fair market value of the share at the time of the purchase or subscription of the shares or at the time of the execution of the option right. If it is a question of an issue of new shares and the issue is directed to the majority of the personnel, the subscription price may be, at most, 10% lower than the fair market value without the benefit being considered taxable.</p>
               <p>The benefit is taxed as earned income in the hands of the employee, i.e. as salary. The employer must therefore withhold advance wage tax and pay the employer’s social security contributions on the benefit. If the benefit is granted by a foreign parent company to employees of a Finnish subsidiary, the cost for the benefit (e.g. the value of the shares given to the employees) may be charged back to the Finnish subsidiary. The cost of benefit and the social security charge are tax deductible for the employer. If the employee is the sole or majority shareholder, and the benefit is not accounted for as salary, it may be deemed to be a hidden profit distribution and the deduction may be denied for tax purposes (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_6.1.5.">6.1.5.</xref>).</p>

               <title>Interest</title>
               <p>In general, interest expenses are deductible. They are tax deductible for a debtor even if tied to its result (section 18 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). However, a general limitation on the deductibility of interest expenses between related parties applies (<emph type="i">see</emph> below). Companies may deduct interest on a loan obtained to finance a dividend payment or on a loan to finance an acquisition of a target company or a portion of it. The fact that the related dividend income may be tax exempt does not prevent the deductibility.</p>
               <p>The sourcing rules explained in section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.2.1.">1.2.1.</xref> may effectively limit the deductibility of interest in rare cases. The reason is that interest expenses relating to income other than business income may not be netted against the business income. An example would be a debt-financed acquisition of real property which is not used in the business of the taxpayer or in the business of related parties. In such a case, interest expenses could be deducted from the revenues generated by the real property.</p>
               <p>Generally, a local holding company may be used to push down acquisition-related debt. Thus, a local debt-financed holding company may be deemed to conduct business and qualify for a local group contribution.</p>
               <p>Interest paid to related companies and to other related parties, such as shareholders, must correspond to that charged in an arm’s length transaction. The interest in excess of the arm’s length level is not tax deductible and may be regarded as hidden profit distribution if paid to a shareholder (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_6.1.5.">6.1.5.</xref>).</p>

               <title>Research and development</title>
               <p>Expenses explicitly listed as deductible include research and development (R&amp;D) expenses (section 8(1)(6) of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). The law does not contain a definition for R&amp;D expenditure. In light of case law and jurisprudence, deductible R&amp;D expenditure includes costs incurred in surveys, planning or marketing aimed at the development of production or marketing, and planning for development of products. Examples of research activity expenditure are payroll costs, acquisition cost of material and equipment used in the research activity, as well as acquisition costs of buildings, machinery, furniture, equipment, etc., acquired for the purposes of the research activity. For the deductibility it is not required that the project to which the expenditure relates is successful.</p>
               <p>Deductible R&amp;D expenditure may be incurred directly by the taxpayer or indirectly through a research company or institution. In the latter case, payments to research institutions have been excepted as deductible even where the payment is not a consideration for specific research results received by the taxpayer; in this case, the research must be related to the field of business of the taxpayer. Payments for expenditure incurred abroad are treated the same way as expenditure incurred domestically. In the case of payments abroad within a group of companies, the provisions regarding the arm’s length requirement and hidden profit distribution (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_6.1.5.">6.1.5.</xref>) should be observed.</p>
               <p>According to the general rule of section 22(1) of the EVL, expenditure is deductible in the year during which it has been incurred. Section 25 of the EVL repeats the same general rule specifically for R&amp;D expenditure (other than expenditure for the acquisition of a building or construction, <emph type="i">see</emph> below). The latter provision, however, also allows upon a taxpayer’s request such expenditure to be deducted through depreciation allowances, in which case the taxpayer may freely determine the number of years (between 2 and 10 years) and the amount of allowances taken per year.</p>
               <p>Under section 34(2)(5) of the EVL, expenditure for the acquisition of a building or construction (or part of a building or construction) used exclusively for research aimed at promoting a business is deductible at a rate of 20% (declining balance method).</p>
               <p>The total deduction for R&amp;D expenditure (whether deducted currently or through depreciation) may not exceed the amount recorded in the taxpayer’s accounts during the tax year and earlier years (section 54(2) of the EVL).</p>
               <p>Between 2021 and 2027, a temporary incentive for R&amp;D costs applies (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.9.2.">1.9.2.</xref>).</p>

               <title>General principles</title>
               <p>The Business Income Tax Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>) contains detailed rules on the depreciation of different kinds of assets (sections 30-45a of the EVL). Depreciation of land, securities and participations in other companies or partnerships is not allowed.</p>
               <p>The general method of depreciation is the declining-balance method which is applied to fixed assets, such as machinery, equipment and buildings. All machinery and equipment is pooled for tax depreciation purposes. Depreciation is allowed on every item which was put into use before the end of the accounting year.</p>
               <p>Straight-line depreciation is applied to long-term expenditures and intangible rights, such as patents and trademarks. The company may take full depreciation if the asset is acquired or, in the case of long-term expenditures, the expenses are incurred prior to the end of the tax year.</p>
               <p>For natural resources, the depletion method is applied and the computation is based on the quantity of the natural resources used.</p>
               <p>In order to be deductible for tax purposes, the depreciated amounts must also cumulatively be expensed in the accounts of the company. Because of this requirement, companies record depreciation of assets required for tax purposes and exceeding the plan for accounting purposes under the heading “Depreciation in excess of plan” in their profit and loss accounts. Accrued depreciations in excess of plan are presented in the balance sheet under the heading “Accelerated depreciations” (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.9.1.">1.9.1.</xref>).</p>
               <p>A taxpayer may freely elect whether to depreciate the assets for tax purposes in a particular tax year. However, amortization or straight-line depreciation must be claimed annually. In certain cases it may be beneficial not to make depreciation for tax purposes, especially if the company has losses. Accounting depreciation may be omitted for tax purposes in the tax return. The postponed tax depreciation may then be utilized in a later tax year, provided that the depreciable assets have not been sold or otherwise disposed of.</p>
               <p>If a taxpayer’s tax year exceeds or is less than 12 months, the maximum depreciation claim is affected. The maximum claim per tax year according to the declining balance method is not increased even if the tax year is longer than 12 months. On the other hand, the company may claim the maximum depreciation if the tax year is shorter than 12 months.</p>

               <title>Plant, machinery and equipment</title>
               <p>The law contains no provisions governing the depreciation of an entire plant. Instead, depreciation is taken on the individual assets in the plant or on machinery and equipment, that is, on a group of assets. The acquisition value of lifts, central heating, plant machinery and equipment, ovens, refrigerators and freezers, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, communal aerials and other similar assets, even though such items constitute part of a building, is depreciated using the method that is applied to machinery and equipment.</p>
               <p>In general, a company may depreciate, using the declining-balance method, up to 25% of the total net tax book values of the company’s entire pool of machinery and equipment (section 30 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>) (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.7.">1.7.</xref>). The total net tax book value consists of the net tax book value of machinery and equipment at the beginning of the tax year, increased by the acquisition value of other machinery and equipment acquired during the year, and reduced by the proceeds derived from the sale or alienation thereof. The accounting treatment differs from the tax treatment.</p>
               <p>A taxpayer may choose any depreciation percentage between 0% and 25% annually.</p>
               <p>In theory, under the declining-balance method, a zero tax value of the total machinery and equipment will never be reached and, unless new machinery and equipment is acquired correspondingly, the taxpayer faces steadily decreasing amounts to be taken as depreciation, even though the maximum rate of 25% is applied. Even if the tax value of machinery and equipment were to approach zero, the taxpayer would not be entitled to depreciate the value thereof to zero if the machinery and equipment still have market value.</p>
               <p>The acquisition value includes the purchase price of the asset, all related costs, such as installation costs and related levies, duties and taxes, excluding VAT (because VAT is credited within the VAT system).</p>
               <p>The acquisition value of assets acquired during the year includes expenses for the extension, change, renewal, and other similar basic improvements of machinery and equipment and, at the request of the taxpayer, also significant expenses for repair (section 30.2 of the EVL).</p>
               <p>As an exception to the main rule, the acquisition value of automobiles which are used for business purposes, such as buses, trucks, and taxis, may be depreciated by applying the following maximum depreciation rates to the acquisition value over 5 successive years: 25%, 20%, 20%, 15% and 15% (section 33 of the EVL). If this depreciation method is used instead of the main depreciation rule, the profit on the sale or other transfer of assets at prices in excess of the net book value is deemed to be taxable income in the year of the sale or transfer.</p>
               <p>As another exception to the main rule, the acquisition value of pleasure boats (i.e. boats not directly used in business) is depreciable over a 10-year period at the minimum by applying the straight-line depreciation method (section 33a of the EVL). Hence, the maximum annual rate of depreciation for pleasure boats is 10%. It should, however, be noted that if the boat has initially been purchased for entertainment purposes, only 50% of the original purchase price is depreciable (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.4.9.">1.4.9.</xref>).</p>
               <p>The acquisition value of construction, equipment, machinery and other assets utilized to prevent water and air pollution is depreciated by write-offs of not more than 25% per year (thus, in 4 or more years).</p>
               <p>Equipment, machinery and other assets that have a probable economic life of 3 years or less may be depreciated immediately (section 33 of the EVL). If such assets are not depreciated (expensed) immediately, they must be depreciated according to the main rule that applies to machinery and equipment. In principle, equipment, machinery and other assets that have a probable economic life of more than 3 years must be capitalized and depreciated according to the rules above. However, fixed assets that have a value of less than EUR 1,200 (EUR 850 before 2021) may be expensed immediately even though the economic life exceeds 3 years. The total value of assets so expensed may not exceed EUR 3,600 (EUR 2,500 before 2021) per tax year.</p>
               <p>If the taxpayer can prove that the market value of fixed assets or, in the case of machinery and equipment, the market value of all assets, at the end of the tax year is, after depreciation at the maximum regular rate in that year, lower than the remaining value for tax purposes, additional depreciation equal to the difference is allowed (sections 32 and 40 of the EVL). However, for shelters or construction, equipment, machinery and other assets for the prevention of water and air pollution, the additional depreciation deduction is allowed only if the reduction in value results from accidental damage or a similar event.</p>

               <p>Regulations on capital gains are included in the Business Income Tax Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). Capital gains are generally regarded as ordinary business income and taxed accordingly (section 5 of the EVL). If investments in other companies, partnerships, etc. or in immovable property are not regarded as having been made for business purposes, the capital gains are taxed according to the Income Tax Law (section 45 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>). However, the computation of capital gains in both laws is equal as regards capital gains derived by companies.</p>
               <p>The tax is levied on capital gains realized on the disposal of assets for cash or other property. For instance, share-for-share exchanges are taxable transactions, although the actual payment of tax may be deferred under the special provisions implementing the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2_76_eng_2009_tt">Merger Directive (2009/133)</extxref> (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_9.2.2.">9.2.2.</xref>).</p>

               <title>Realization</title>
               <p>Capital gains are usually realized when a company sells or disposes of its assets. This occurs when an agreement is concluded which legally binds both parties. A merger or a division which qualifies for tax-neutral treatment is not treated as a realization for the absorbed company or its shareholders. It does not interrupt the ownership period or affect the original acquisition cost. Share-for-share exchanges, tax-neutral transfers of business and other exchanges of property are deemed to be disposals of assets and generally give rise to taxation unless exempt (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.7.6.">1.7.6.</xref>).</p>
               <p>If a company is liquidated, the remaining assets are usually distributed among the shareholders. If the value of a shareholder’s distributive share exceeds the remaining acquisition cost for tax purposes (tax-free return of capital), the excess is effectively taxed as a capital gain (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_9.5.2.">9.5.2.</xref>).

               <p>If the business operations of a company yield a net loss, this loss may be carried forward for tax purposes and set off against future business profits. The loss may be carried forward for up to 10 tax years (sections 120 to 123a of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>). Set-offs must follow the sequence in which the losses occurred. Losses may be set off only against income from the same income source.</p>
               <p>If more than 50% of the shares in a company are sold in a loss year or thereafter, the right to carry forward the loss is forfeited. The tax office may, however, authorize such carry-forward if it is necessary for the continuation of the company’s activities (section 122(3) of the TVL). Losses which are only deductible on the basis of such an authorization may not, however, be offset against income which is received as group contribution from another group company. However, the tax office may grant a specific authorization in order to allow the company to offset the losses also against received group contribution if the preconditions for group contributions have been fulfilled prior to the transfer of the shares (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_8.2.">8.2.</xref>).</p>
               <p>The authorization procedure as provided in section 122(3) of the TVL had been under the scrutiny of the ECJ. On 30 December 2011, the Supreme Administrative Court has requested a preliminary ruling from the ECJ regarding the application of the special authorization procedure and its compatibility with EU law, in <emph type="i">P Oy</emph> (<extxref publish="n" target="ecjd_c_6_12">Case C-6/12</extxref>). On 18 July 2013, the ECJ gave its decision in this case and concluded that Finnish loss carry-forward rules are not incompatible with EU law.</p>
               <p>For mergers, the surviving company is entitled to deduct from its taxable income losses carried forward by the merged company, provided that the combined holdings of the surviving company and its shareholders have, since the beginning of the loss year, exceeded 50% of the shares in the merged company (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_9.2.">9.2.</xref>). These principles also apply when a partnership is transformed into a company.</p>
               <p>Indirect ownership changes also affect loss carry-forwards. If more than 50% of the shares of a company that owns at least 20% of the loss-making company change ownership, all the shares of the loss-making company owned by the other company are deemed, for the purpose of loss carry-forward, to have changed ownership.</p>
               <p>There are no provisions for the carry-back of losses. Consequently, when a company is liquidated, unabsorbed losses are forfeited.</p>

               <title>Capital losses</title>
               <p>Losses suffered on the sale or other disposal of business assets are considered to be part of ordinary losses. Losses suffered on the sale or other disposal of assets not relating to the business belong to “other income”. These losses may only be deducted from capital gains arising from disposals of non-business related assets in the same accounting year or in any of the following 5 years (section 50 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>).</p>
               <p>Capital losses incurred on shares are not deductible if corresponding gains would be exempt from tax (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.7.5.">1.7.5.</xref>) (section 6b(1) of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). Under all other circumstances, such losses are deductible. However, the losses may be offset only against taxable gains on the sale of shares within the same tax year or the 5 following years (section 6b(4) of the EVL). The offset is limited to shares that are treated as fixed assets. In addition, if the company has owned the shares for less than 1 year, distributed dividends, group contributions and similar items that decrease the value of the company are deducted in determining the deductible loss (section 6b(5) of the EVL).</p>
               <p>The above rules on share losses apply correspondingly in the case of a liquidation. It should be noted, however, that the liquidation loss is not deductible even if the company has owned the shares for less than 1 year (in which case the corresponding liquidation gain would be taxable) (section 51d of the EVL).</p>

               <p>A company must file a tax return on an accounting year basis, within 4 months from the end of each accounting year. The accounting year of a company ordinarily runs from 1 January to 31 December (calendar year) and the tax return is filed on or before 30 April of the following year. If the due date occurs on a weekend or a public holiday the tax return may be filed or mailed on the following working day. Companies whose accounting year does not correspond to the calendar year may file their tax returns within 4 months from the beginning of the calendar month immediately following the end of their accounting year. For example, if a company’s accounting period ends on 15 March 2022, the corporate tax return will be due on 31 July 2022. If several accounting periods end during a calendar year, the company must file a combined tax return for all of them. The tax administration issues instructions on the filing and information requirements for the tax return.</p>
               <p>Companies must generally file their tax returns electronically using an online filing system (“MyTax service”), electronic data interchange or “Tyvi service”. Instructions in English are available at <url target="http://www.vero.fi">www.vero.fi</url>.</p>
               <p>A non-resident or a branch of a foreign company must submit its tax return to the tax administration via the online filing system. It is handled by the Corporate Tax Unit (Helsinki). If, as an exception, a non-resident files its tax return on paper because of a specific reason, such as "MyTax service" not being available, the tax return may be submitted to any tax office in Finland or a foreign embassy of Finland that will forward it to the Tax Office of Etelä-Suomi or Tax Office for Major Corporations.</p>
               <p>The tax office may require a company to furnish additional information pertinent to its tax return.</p>
               <p>A company is obligated to maintain accounting records in Finland for at least 6 years after the end of the calendar year in which the accounting year ended. (This time period corresponds to the maximum period for additional assessments levied by the tax authorities.)</p>

               <p>With effect from 1 May 2018, the assessment is finalized individually for each taxpayer. The date of the end of the assessment is stated on the assessment decision. If the company provides additional information or a revised tax return affecting its assessment before the end date of the assessment, the tax administration issues a revised assessment decision (section 49 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>).</p>
               <p>Ordinary assessments must be completed by the end of October in the calendar year following the company’s tax year. However, for companies, the assessment must be completed within 10 months from the end of the last month of the accounting year (section 49 of the VML). If 2 or more accounting years end during the calendar year, the 10-month period runs from the end of the last month of the most recent accounting period. For example, if a company’s accounting year runs from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, the tax return must be filed on 31 July 2022, at the latest. If mailed, the tax return must arrive by the due date of 31 July 2022 at the tax administration. The assessment will then be finalized on 31 January 2023.</p>
               <p>Irrespective of the date of the assessment decision, the tax administration may extend the assessment period if it is required for the purposes of the audit or inspection. The tax administration must send a notification to the taxpayer prior to the end of the assessment period. The assessment is finalized on the date of the new assessment decision.</p>
               <p>The assessment and tax audit, as well as any advisory work, for the largest companies engaged in international operations are concentrated at the Tax Office for Major Corporations. This tax office is located in Helsinki, but also companies resident elsewhere in Finland fall under its jurisdiction. It is authorized to assess both corporate income tax and VAT, to control the payment of withholding tax on wages, and to perform tax audits in all these tax areas.</p>
               <p>The tax office may, for the final assessment, deviate from the tax return filed by the company, but the taxpayer is allowed to give an explanation with respect to disputed issues before any deviation takes place. If the tax return is considered unreliable, tax may be assessed on the basis of estimated income. The taxpayer has, however, an opportunity to provide additional information to support his original tax return. If no tax return is filed, the tax office can also make the assessment on the basis of estimated income, but the taxpayer has the opportunity to provide information on the correct amount of income (section 27 of the VML).</p>

In contrast, corrections that are favourable to the taxpayer may be made within 3 years from the beginning of the year following the end of the tax year (sections 55, 56, 56 b of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>).For tax years that ended before 1 January 2017, the correction time is 5 years following the year of assessment. With effect from 1 January 2017, in the case of certain criminal proceedings, an additional assessment may be carried out within 1 year from the end of the year in which the public prosecutor started the prosecution (section 56 c of the VML). The tax authorities must make the decision on the correction within the period stated in the law.</p>
               <p>Unless the case has already been decided on appeal, a company which is dissatisfied with a final tax assessment may appeal to a rectification board. A company must file a rectification request to the rectification board, in general, within 3 years (before 1 January 2017, within 5 years) from the beginning of the year immediately following the end of the tax year. In turn, the tax authorities must file an appeal within 4 months (before 1 January 2017, within 1 year) (section 64 of the VML). If the rectification board agrees with the taxpayer, the tax administration rectifies the assessment (section 61 of the VML). In these cases, the tax administration may rectify the assessment to the extent it does not dispute the taxpayer’s appeal.</p>
               <p>For example, for the tax year from 1 January until 31 December 2019, for which the assessment may be completed by the end of October 2020, the appeal for a correction must be filed by 31 December 2022, at the latest. </p>
               <p>Any decision of the rectification board may be appealed to an administrative court, which is an intermediate administrative tribunal. With effect from 1 January 2017, the taxpayer and the tax administration must file the appeal within 60 days after the decision of the rectification board is handed down (sections 66 and 67 of the VML). The statute of limitation for the tax authorities is calculated from the date of the decision, and for the taxpayer from the date of the receipt of the decision. Before that date, the taxpayer was required to file the appeal within 5 years from the beginning of the year immediately following the end of the assessment year, while the tax administration was required to file the appeal within 1 year from the beginning of the calendar year following the end of the assessment.</p>
               <p>The taxpayer and representative of the state may appeal the decisions of the administrative court to the Supreme Administrative Court within 60 days, but only if the Court grants permission for the appeal. Permission is granted only if:</p>

               <title>Payment of tax and refunds</title>
               <p>Most company taxes are collected during the tax year through advance payments. The advance payment system is governed by the Law on Tax Procedure and the Precollection Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_epl">EPL</xref>) and has two distinctive features:</p>
               <list>

                     <p>preassessment and collection of estimated tax amounts with respect to business and other income.</p>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Withholding taxes from wages, salaries, etc. are paid monthly using the online filing system ("MyTax service") on a self-assessment basis.</p>
               <p>The preassessment of taxes on, for example, business income is carried out by the tax administration. Pre-assessed taxes are ordinarily established with reference to the taxpayer’s income in the previous ordinary assessment and match, as accurately as possible, the taxpayers’ final taxes for the entire tax year. The pre-assessed tax amounts for the relevant tax year may be changed until the company’s assessment has been finalized if it becomes evident that they will not match the final taxes (chapter 2, section 24 of the EPL). With effect from 2019, the tax authorities' decisions on pre-assessed tax amounts do not expire automatically and remain enforceable until the tax is paid or the decision is nullified following the taxpayer's application. Accordingly, where a pre-assessed tax amount is excessive, a taxpayer must submit an application, and claim the excessive advance taxes to be nullified. </p>
               <p>Pre-assessed tax amounts for companies are collected in 2 or 12 instalments. If the total amount to be paid is not more than EUR 2,000, the instalments are due in the third and in the ninth month of the accounting period. If the total amount to be paid exceeds EUR 2,000, the instalments are due monthly from January to December for calendar year-based companies (section 2 of <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_veroh">VEROH</xref> 967/2016).</p>
               <p>Advance payments are credited against the taxpayer’s final taxes. If the final taxes exceed the advance payments, the difference is payable in the form of supplementary payments as stated in the final assessment decision by the tax administration. A non-deductible penalty interest is imposed on the supplementary payments at an annual rate of 2% in 2017-2022 (2.5% for 2014-2016). To avoid the penalty interest, the taxpayer must make the supplementary payment within 1 month following the end of the last month of the accounting and tax year. The supplementary payment is hence made on a self-assessment basis. </p>
               <p>If the advance payments exceed the final tax assessed, the excess is refunded (plus an interest of 0.5% for 2017-2022) to the taxpayer when the final assessment for the taxpayer is completed (within 10 months following the end of the relevant tax year). </p>

               <title>Late payment interest and penalties</title>
               <p>If advance taxes paid by a taxpayer do not cover the final taxes assessed by the tax authorities, a non-deductible penalty interest is charged (section 40 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>). For details, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.11.4.">1.11.4.</xref> </p>
               <p>If the assessed tax is paid after the due date or if the tax has been assessed outside of the ordinary assessment, interest is imposed on late payment of tax. The interest rate varies annually (7% for 2017-2022, and 7.5% for 2014-2016).</p>
               <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a support measure was introduced for unpaid taxes that were part of a repayment arrangement agreed with the tax authorities. With effect from 1 May 2021, the interest rate was reduced to 2.5% (from 7%) on unpaid taxes covered by payment arrangements already in place and new arrangements for which the application had to be submitted until 31 August 2021. The reduced rate applies until the end of the payment arrangement. The maximum duration is 2 years. With effect from 1 January 2018, a penalty of EUR 100 may be imposed for the late filing of a return. </p>
               <p>If a tax return includes incomplete, inaccurate or incorrect information, and in the cases where a taxpayer fails to file a tax return, a penalty of up to 10% of the added income may be imposed.</p>
               <p>If the taxpayer does not provide information requested by the tax authorities during the assessment or a tax audit, a penalty of up to 10% of the added income applies.</p>
               <p>A penalty of up to 50% is calculated on the adjusted tax, based on an estimated assessment by the tax authorities, where a taxpayer failed to comply with his obligation to file tax returns (sections 32 and 32a of the VML), <emph type="i">see also</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.11.2.">1.11.2.</xref> </p>
               <p>None of the above-mentioned payments are tax deductible.</p>
               <p>The Law on Tax Procedure (VML) includes penalties for filing fraudulent returns and other violations. Serious violations are punishable as fraud or embezzlement under the criminal law, for example by the imposition of fines or prison terms for a maximum of 2 years. In the most serious cases, the minimum prison term is 4 months and the maximum is 4 years. If the misconduct is not sufficiently serious to warrant imprisonment, fines are the only form of punishment imposed (section 86 of the VML; chapter 29 of the Penal Code). Administrative penalties may also be imposed.</p>

               <title>Rulings</title>
               <p>Taxpayers may apply for advance rulings from the Central Tax Board (<emph type="i">Keskusverolautakunta</emph>) on issues involving income tax, value added tax, taxation of non-residents, withholding tax on interest or insurance tax. Rulings are issued on matters that are considered to be important and that may set a precedent, and on those of significant economic value to the taxpayer. Rulings are issued ordinarily within a couple of months from the date of the request. They must be applied during the tax year in question and until the tax return for it must be submitted. While the Central Tax Board lays out the tax consequences of a proposed transaction upon the taxpayer’s request, it does not advise the taxpayer on how to minimize taxes. Hence, the formulation of the question is of crucial importance. A legal fee varying between EUR 980 and 4,200 is payable for advance rulings of the Central Tax Board (Decree 1135/2021, valid through 31 December 2024).</p>
               <p>Decisions of the Central Tax Board are binding on the tax authorities, but not on the taxpayer. The taxpayer may freely choose whether it demands the tax authorities to apply the ruling. In order for the ruling to be binding there is a requirement that all relevant facts relating to the transaction have been disclosed. Both the authorities and the taxpayer may appeal an advance ruling to the Supreme Administrative Court (chapter 3 of the Law on tax administration, <emph type="i">Laki verohallinnosta/Lag on skatteförvaltningen</emph>).</p>
               <p>The tax administration, including the Tax Office for Major Corporations, issue advance rulings on matters involving income tax, value added tax, taxation of non-residents, withholding tax on interest, insurance tax, payroll withholding, inheritance tax, transfer tax, lottery tax and real estate tax (section 85 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref> and chapter 3 of the Law on tax administration). The cost of an advance ruling issued by a tax office varies between EUR 255 and 2,520 (Decree 1135/2021, valid through 31 December 2024).</p>
               <p>The most important difference between the advance ruling from the tax office and that from the Central Board of Taxation is the fact that only the tax office is permitted to rule on valuation matters. For example, an advance ruling on transfer pricing matters must be sought from the tax office if, as is often the case, a judgement on valuation is sought.</p>

               <title>Tax audit/examination</title>
               <p>Tax audits are performed at irregular intervals by tax auditors employed by the tax administration. Tax audits are normally integrated, which means that income taxes, VAT matters and salary withholdings are examined at the same time. Tax auditors are entitled to examine the accounts of a company and to request additional information which they deem necessary to the examination. Audits may take place at the taxpayer’s premises or elsewhere (section 14 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>; section 3 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vma">VMA</xref>).</p>
               <p>The tax administration usually gives the taxpayer advance notice of an audit. However, in rare cases, they may conduct an audit without prior notice if they have sufficient evidence that the taxpayer is likely to destroy accounting records to avoid an additional assessment.</p>

            <title>Social security contributions</title>
            <p>Employers must make various social security contributions in respect of their employees:</p>
            <list>
               <item label="-">
                  <p>a health insurance contribution;</p>
               </item>
               <item label="-">
                  <p>an employment pension insurance contribution;</p>
               </item>
               <item label="-">
                  <p>an unemployment insurance contribution; and</p>
               </item>
               <item label="-">
                  <p>an accidental insurance contribution, including a group life insurance contribution.</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Employers must make a health insurance contribution to the state to cover the costs of the national health insurance. The contribution is applied to the annual total amount of the gross remuneration paid to the employees, without a ceiling amount. The contribution is computed on the basis of the amount of monthly salaries paid. The rate for 2022 is 1.34% (1.53% in 2021) (Decree on Social Security Contributions).</p>
            <p>In addition, employers must pay an employment pension insurance contribution of 17.40% (on average) (16.95% in 2021), an unemployment insurance contribution of 0.5% on the first EUR 2,197,500 in 2022 (0.5% on the first EUR 2,169,500 in 2021) and 2.05% on the excess in 2022 (1.9% in 2021) (Law 24.7.1998/555), and an accidental injury insurance contribution (including group life insurance) of approximately 0.76% of the employees’ annual gross wages and salaries in 2022. These types of insurance are usually purchased from private insurance companies. Private insurance companies give client rebates that vary on average between 0.25% and 0.5% of the employer’s total employment pension premiums and thus reduce the total premiums.</p>
            <p>The social security contributions mentioned above and made by employers are deductible as business expenses.</p>
            <p>An employment pension insurance contribution of 7.15% (8.65% if the employee is 53 to 62 years old, and 7.15% if the employee is 63 to 67 years old) and an unemployment insurance contribution of 1.5% (1.4 in 2021) of the employee’s salary income are collected from employees. These contributions are tax deductible for the employee. Employees must also make a health insurance contribution. In 2022, the health insurance contribution of 1.71% (2.04% in 2021) consists of two components, i.e. a 1.18% health care component and a 0.53% daily allowance component. Only the latter component is deductible for income tax purposes. The employee contributions are withheld by the employer and remitted to the relevant authorities.</p>
            <p>A resident company and a permanent establishment of a non-resident company having foreign employees in Finland are required to pay premiums for the compulsory employment-related insurance, i.e. employment pension, group-life, accident and unemployment insurance. These forms of insurance are required regardless of whether the employees are seconded from abroad or reside in Finland. A resident company is also required to pay the employer health insurance contribution on salaries paid to foreign employees working in Finland (section 1 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tyel">TyEL</xref>, and section 1 of the Law on Employer's Health Insurance Premium). However, a company can avoid the obligation to insure its employees and pay the employer health insurance contribution for employees seconded from abroad if a social security agreement exists between Finland and the country from which the employees are sent, or if the employees are seconded from an <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_eea">EEA</xref> country. In this case, a certificate for the seconded employee is needed to show that the employee remains insured in his country of residence.</p>
            <p>A non-resident company that has employees in Finland is required to participate in certain compulsory employment-related insurance schemes, i.e. employment pension, group-life, accident, and unemployment insurance, regardless of whether the employees are seconded from abroad or reside in Finland. The obligation to insure employees does not depend upon the existence of a permanent establishment or representative of the non-resident company in Finland. However, the obligation to pay the employer health insurance contribution only arises when the non-resident company has a permanent establishment or a representative in Finland, which pays the salaries of employees in Finland. If the non-resident company has neither a permanent establishment nor a representative in Finland, which pays salaries, it has no obligation to pay the employer health insurance contribution.</p>

            <p>Real estate tax (<emph type="i">kiinteistövero</emph>; <emph type="i">fastighetsskatt</emph>) is levied on immovable property in Finland regardless of its function, except farm and forest land (sections 1 to 3 of the Real Estate Tax Law). Real estate tax is also levied on buildings situated on leased land, although such buildings are generally treated as movable property under the Finnish legal system (section 2 of the Real Estate Tax Law).</p>
            <p>The real estate tax rate that applies to buildings used for residential purposes ranges between 0.41% and 1%. With effect from 1 January 2020, the real estate tax rates applicable to other kinds of immovable property range between 0.93% and 2%. A special rate between 2% and 6% may be applied to certain unbuilt immovable property within city zoning areas. In the metropolitan area, an addition of 3% to the general real estate rate must be applied on unbuilt land. However, the maximum may not exceed 6% of the taxable value of the property. Municipalities may set a rate of real estate tax that falls within these limits; the revenue collected belongs entirely to the municipality in which the immovable property is located (sections 11, 12 and 13 of the Real Estate Tax Law). Real estate tax is a deductible expense for corporate income tax purposes.</p>

               <p>Until 1989 and with effect from 1 January 2005, Finland has applied the classical double tax system with some modifications. With effect from 1 January 2005, double taxation of dividends received is alleviated at the shareholder level under the participation exemption in section 6a of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref> and section 33 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>.</p>
               <p>For corporate shareholders, dividends received are tax-exempt income with a few exceptions. For individual shareholders dividends received from a quoted company are either tax-free or taxable capital income. Dividends distributed by a private company are tax exempt, or taxed as capital or earned income.</p>
               <p>A dividend is not defined in the tax law. Distributions which are treated as a dividend in the company law and which are based on shares owned and distributable earnings of the company are also dividends for tax purposes. Redemption of shares and liquidations are not treated as dividend distributions.</p>
               <p>The distribution of assets by a quoted company from its free own capital is treated as a distribution of dividends.</p>
               <p>The participation exemption for dividends applies to profit distributions by domestic cooperatives, savings banks, mutual insurance companies and insurance associations (section 6a.4 of the EVL)</p>

               <p>The tax treatment of domestic dividends depends on whether or not the distributing company is quoted. A quoted company is defined in the Income Tax Law (section 33 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>).</p>
               <p>A distribution of 85% of dividends from a quoted company to a Finnish resident individual is taxed as capital income, while the remaining 15% is tax exempt.</p>
               <p>When a non-quoted company distributes dividends, 25% of the annual dividends are taxed as income from capital and 75% are exempt up to EUR 150,000 per shareholder per year, provided the amount of the dividends does not exceed an 8% annual yield on the net worth of the company per share calculated according to the Law on Valuation of Assets for Taxation Purposes. Fifteen per cent of such dividends exceeding EUR 150,000, but within the 8% yield ceiling, is exempt, with the remaining 85% being taxed as the shareholder’s income from capital.</p>
               <p>If the amount of dividends exceeds the 8% yield ceiling, 75% of the exceeding part of the dividends are taxed as earned income and 25% are exempt. Earned income is subject to progressive taxation.</p>
               <p>Dividends from a resident quoted company to a resident individual shareholder are subject to advance withholding at a rate of 25.5%. Dividends up to EUR 150,000 from a non-quoted company to a resident individual are subject to an advance withholding tax at a rate of 7.5%. The rate of the advance tax is 28% on the amount of dividends exceeding EUR 150,000. The paying company must monitor the ceiling for each individual recipient (section 15 of the Pre-collection Decree: <emph type="i">Ennakkoperintäasetus</emph>).</p>
               <p>Dividends paid to non-resident individuals from resident companies are subject to taxation at source. The rate is normally reduced by the relevant income tax treaty. For domestic dividends, individuals resident in the European Economic Area benefit from the same tax treatment as resident individuals. Additionally, the dividends may be exempted from the domestic withholding altogether if certain requirements are met (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_7.3.4.1.">7.3.4.1.</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Individual shareholders who are resident for Finnish tax purposes pay tax of 30% on capital gains up to EUR 30,000 received from the sale of shares and 34% on the excess. The capital gain is the difference between the sales price and the purchase price. However, an individual shareholder is entitled to deduct as the purchase price 20% of the sales price, or for property owned for at least 10 years, 40% of the sales price. This rule was enacted for the benefit of the taxpayer, which means that any actual purchase price greater than 20% or 40%, respectively, of the sales price may be used. The sales expenses are tax deductible when the actual acquisition price is used, but not when a higher proportional acquisition value is used.</p>
                  <p>Capital losses may be carried forward for up to 5 years and deducted from future capital gains.</p>
                  <p>Capital gains derived by non-residents on shares in resident companies are exempt according to section 10 10-k of the Income Tax Law; <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_7.3.3.5.">7.3.3.5.</xref> </p>

               <p>According to company legislation, a company is allowed to purchase its own shares, but not all of them, if the company has retained earnings which cover the acquisition price of the shares. The number of own shares held by a public company may not, however, exceed 10% of all its shares (chapter 15, section 11(1) of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_oyl_2">OYL</xref>). Shares which are acquired in this manner and exceed the 10% threshold must be sold or invalidated within 3 years (chapter 15, section 12(2) of the OYL) (<emph type="i">see</emph> <extxref publish="n" target="gthc_fi_s_1.">Finland – Business and Investment – Country Surveys</extxref>).</p>
               <p>Companies other than public companies must divest their own shares within 1 year from the purchase.</p>
               <p>A company may also redeem its own shares by decreasing the share capital of the company. This requires permission from the trade register. The shares must be invalidated and the company which made the redemption by decreasing its share capital may not distribute dividends in the subsequent 3 years, unless the share capital is increased back to the previous level by issuing new shares.</p>
               <p>Income on the sale of shares is not taxable for the selling public or private company. The related acquisition cost of the company’s own shares is not tax deductible either, except when a public company disposes of its shares as a salary to employees. The public company may claim such a deduction during the tax year in which it disposes of the shares acquired from the stock market to its employees.</p>
               <p>A redemption of shares may be regarded as a hidden profit distribution, especially if only part of the shares of each shareholder are redeemed. A redemption of all of the shares from one or more shareholders, to transfer the company, e.g. from father to son, is however usually not regarded as hidden profit distribution.

According to the Income Tax Law (section 13a of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>), a permanent establishment is a place in which a specific business is permanently conducted or there are special arrangements for carrying on business, such as:</p>

                  <p>Finland applies the OECD Model definition of permanent establishment in most of its tax treaties. However, there are important exceptions, such as the treaty of 4 May 1996 with Russia, as amended by the protocol of 14 April 2000 and as modified by the MLI signed by Finland and Russia on 7 June 2017. Under that treaty (article 5(3)), a building site or construction, assembly or installation project or connected supervisory activities constitute a permanent establishment if the site, project or activities last, in the case of a site or project involving mainly the erection of factories, workshops, power stations or any other industrial buildings or structures, for more than 18 months and, in all other cases, for more than 12 months. The use of an installation or drilling rig or ship for the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources constitutes a permanent establishment if the rig or ship is used for more than 12 months.</p>

                  <p>Companies are taxed on income regardless of whether it originates from Finland or elsewhere. Profits of permanent establishments in foreign countries are calculated according to domestic rules and the resulting double taxation is generally alleviated in Finland under the ordinary credit method or under the exemption method if the relevant treaty so provides.</p>
                  <p>The tax administration publishes instructions on Finnish international taxation which give guidance on treatment of foreign permanent establishments in addition to case law.</p>
                  <p>Income and the related expenses are allocated to the foreign permanent establishment as the taxpayer may not conclude transactions between the headquarters and the permanent establishment for civil law purposes. The allocation is a matter of evidence. To its annual tax return in Finland, the taxpayer must annex a profit and loss calculation of a foreign permanent establishment prepared according to Finnish tax rules.</p>
                  <p>Depreciation is calculated using the same rate the taxpayer has claimed for the tax year in question. In general, assets including inventory may be transferred from the resident head office to a branch without tax consequences. “Payments” to a branch are not deductible and “profit distributions” by a branch do not affect the taxation of the head office.</p>
                  <p>A business loss of a foreign branch is netted against business income in Finland unless it originates from a treaty country applying the exemption method to relieve double taxation. A foreign branch loss exceeding the taxable business income in Finland is carried forward as part of the business loss.</p>

                  <p>With effect from 1 January 2016, dividends received from non-resident companies are taxable if the paying company is allowed to deduct the dividends from its taxable income.

                  <p>Tax treaties usually prevent the taxation of inbound subsidiary dividends also where the distributing companies are resident outside the European Union. In general, the dividend is treated as a subsidiary dividend if the recipient’s ownership is at least 10%. However, the limit should be investigated on a case-by-case basis in the applicable tax treaty.</p>

               <title>Foreign losses</title>
               <p>Finland usually applies the credit method to avoid the double taxation of foreign-source business income. Therefore, all income derived by a foreign branch is also income in the hands of the head office and all costs paid by the branch are deductible by the head office. This means that the losses incurred by the foreign branch may be deducted by the resident head office.</p>
               <p>If an exemption method applies pursuant to the terms of a treaty, the income and costs of the permanent establishment are excluded from the taxable base of the resident head office. As a result, the losses incurred by the foreign branch are not deductible in Finland under the Law on Elimination of International Double Taxation (section 7 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_kvpl">KVPL</xref>).</p>
               <p>With effect from 1 January 2021, a special group deduction applies, under which a resident parent company may deduct the final losses of its subsidiary (resident in another <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_eea">EEA</xref> state). <emph type="i">See</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_8.2.">8.2.</xref>

                  <p>For the purposes of corporate income tax, foreign-source income is included in the company’s income, and tax is computed thereon in the normal manner. Double taxation is eliminated by crediting the tax paid on the foreign income in the source country. Only taxes paid to a foreign state qualify for the credit. Other taxes qualify for a credit if so provided under a treaty (section 3 of the Law on Elimination of International Double Taxation <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_kvpl">KVPL</xref>). The credit is computed separately for each source of income (per basket limitation).</p>
                  <p>The credit is limited to the amount of Finnish tax payable on the foreign-source income. Any unused credit may be carried forward to the following 5 tax years. Foreign income or withholding taxes are not deductible as business expenses.</p>

               <title>Immigration</title>
               <p>With effect from 1 January 2021, it became possible for foreign companies to immigrate to Finland when a definition of the concept of residence was introduced in tax legislation. Accordingly, a foreign company becomes a Finnish resident if it establishes its place of effective management in Finland (section 9 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref> and section 1 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_oyl_2">OYL</xref>). Such companies are liable to tax in Finland on their worldwide profits.</p>
               <p>With effect from 1 January 2020, a valuation rule on the immigration of a non-resident company to Finland is provided in section 51(f) of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>. Under this rule, when transferring assets, tax residence, or business carried on by a permanent establishment to Finland, transferred assets are valued at the market value established by the transferring EU Member State of the taxpayer or of the permanent establishment as the starting value of the assets for tax purposes in Finland. Until 2020, apart from the rules concerning SEs and SCEs, Finland has not had specific rules on the immigration of non-resident companies.</p>
               <p>If an <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_se">SE</xref> or an <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_sce">SCE</xref> transfers its seat to Finland, its status changes from a non-resident company with a branch in Finland to a resident company that is taxable on its worldwide profits. As to the taxation of a European Company, a continuity principle is applied in the transfer of its assets, by virtue of section 52e of the EVL.</p>
               <p>The taxable period begins on the date on which (i) business activities commence in Finland; or (ii) the non-resident entity becomes a tax resident due to having transferred its effective management to Finland. Any foreign branch or non-resident company with its effective management in Finland is required to report this date to the tax authorities. The first taxable period ends on the last day of the ordinary accounting period. A branch must have the same accounting period as its head office.</p>
               <p>On 1 April 2021, the tax administration issued the instructions VH/8343/00.01.00/20 on the tax treatment of resident and non-resident corporations.</p>

                  <p>A non-resident company is taxed on income derived from Finnish sources. The Income Tax Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>) defines the types of income deemed to be from Finnish sources.

                  </list>
                  <p>Interest received by a non-resident is exempt according to section 9.2 of the TVL. The only exception is interest on a loan which is deemed as equity. However, even this is exempt under the treaties concluded by Finland.</p>
                  <p>The Law on Taxation of Non-residents (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_lähdevl">LähdeVL</xref>) taxes the income of a non-resident by either imposing a withholding tax on the gross payment or by assessment. Income not subject to withholding tax or at the election of the non-resident (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_7.3.4.">7.3.4.</xref>) is taxed by assessment at the general corporate income tax rate (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.10.1.">1.10.1.</xref>) (section 4 of the LähdeVL). Examples of income not subject to withholding tax include income from immovable property and business income derived through a permanent establishment.</p>
                  <p>If dividends, interest or royalties are derived through a Finnish permanent establishment of a non-resident company, such income is included in the taxable profits of the permanent establishment and taxed as part of the business profits of the permanent establishment.

                  <p>Generally speaking, all income derived from Finnish activities and all costs, including general administrative costs incurred in the head office, which, under the relevant treaty, may be attributed to a permanent establishment in Finland, is allocated to it. Arm’s length conditions must be applied to transactions between the foreign head office and its branch in Finland even though the branch legally may not conclude contracts with the company to which it belongs (section 31 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>). In addition, the section 9 of the Income Tax Law provides that all such income which is attributed to the assets held by the Finnish permanent establishment must be allocated to the Finnish permanent establishment. The accounting treatment generally determines whether or not the asset is deemed to be part of the permanent establishment’s assets.</p>
                  <p>Branches of non-resident companies are treated for tax purposes as companies: the income attributable to the branch is subject to tax, costs attributable to the branch are deductible, and the tax rate is the general corporate income tax rate (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.10.1.">1.10.1.</xref>). Cost allocation between branch and head office should follow the arm’s length principle and all costs should clearly be connected to the activities of the branch. On the other hand, payments received from the head office are not taxable in the hands of the branch.</p>
                  <p>Interest on loans between a branch and its head office is not tax deductible. On the other hand, interest paid to third parties by either the head office or the branch is tax deductible if the loan benefits the business of the branch (and is therefore attributable to the branch). Similarly, royalty payments to the head office are not deductible from the income of the branch. However, if the head office pays royalties to third parties and these royalties are attributable to the activities of the branch, they are deductible from the branch’s income.</p>
                  <p>Profits may be freely transferred from a Finnish branch to its head office. There are no thin capitalization rules applicable to branches.</p>

                  <p>Royalties derived directly by a non-resident from Finnish sources are subject to withholding tax at source.

                  <p>Under the domestic law implementing the provisions of the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2_82_eng_2003_tt">Interest and Royalties Directive (2003/49)</extxref>, (interest and) royalty payments are exempt from withholding tax, provided that the recipient is an associated company of the paying company and is resident in another Member State or such a company’s permanent establishment situated in another Member State. Two companies are “associated companies” if (i) one of them has a direct minimum holding of 25% in the capital of the other or (ii) a third EU company has a direct minimum holding of 25% in the capital of the two companies. The relevant companies must have a legal form listed in the Annex to the Directive and be subject to corporate income tax. No minimum holding period is required (section 3b-f of the LähdeVL).</p>

                  <title>Withholding procedure</title>
                  <p>Resident companies paying dividends or royalties to non-residents must withhold tax on these payments whenever appropriate (<emph type="i">see</emph> sections <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_7.3.4.">7.3.4.</xref> and <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_7.4.">7.4.</xref>). The withholding tax must be paid to the tax office by the 12th day of the following month. The resident company is liable for failure to pay the proper amount or failure to pay such amount on time. Interest and penalties of up to 30% of the amount of the unpaid withholding tax may be imposed on late payments or upon the company’s failure to pay (section 8 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_lähdevl">LähdeVL</xref>). For the interest rate, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.11.5.">1.11.5.</xref> </p>
                  <p>The company withholding the tax must give a payment receipt certificate (certificate on final tax in Finland) to the non-resident recipient (section 5 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_lähdeva">LähdeVA</xref>). The certificate should state the type of income, year of payment, name of the recipient, the amounts of income and final tax in Finland and the name of the payer.</p>
                  <p>Interest income derived by a non-resident from Finnish sources is usually exempt from tax under domestic law (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_7.3.4.2.">7.3.4.2.</xref>). The company paying the interest is not required to withhold the tax on interest if the non-resident recipient provides the payer with sufficient information to be able to identify the recipient as a non-resident (i.e. the name, date of birth and address in residence state). No particular form is used.</p>
                  <p>If excess tax has been paid in Finland by a non-resident recipient, refund may be claimed from the tax administration. The application must be filed within 3 years immediately following the payment year (section 11(2) of the LähdeVL). The time limit is 5 years for dividends that have been paid in 2016 at the latest. An informal application must include the information that should have already been given to the original payer. A certificate on payment should be attached. The same applies if a Finnish payer has not been able to take into account the exemption granted to qualifying <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_eea">EEA</xref> recipients as described in section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_7.3.4.1.">7.3.4.1.</xref> </p>
                  <p>A special regime applies to dividends paid to non-residents on nominee-registered shares (shares of Finnish companies that are not registered under the name of the beneficial owner but as held by a nominee). If the payer of the dividend has diligently ensured that the recipient is resident in a state with which Finland has a tax treaty, a rate reduced to 15% (or the higher treaty rate) is applied instead of the general 20% rate (which is applied if the recipient is resident in a non-treaty state). If the treaty provides for a rate lower than 15%, the payer may apply the lower rate only if complete information on the nominee-registered beneficial owner of the dividends has been provided.</p>

                     <p>Only a few of Finland’s treaties provide that, in relation to foreign-source income that is only taxable in the state of residence on a remittance basis, the benefit of the treaty is limited to the income that is actually remitted to the residence state.</p>
                     <p>Finland has also included in its tax treaties the possibility to tax, on a global basis, its citizens who are moving abroad for some time. Such provisions are included in the treaties with e.g. Estonia, Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the United States. Finland’s domestic law stipulates that a Finnish national is deemed to remain resident in Finland for 3 years after the end of the year in which he left the country, unless he can show that he has no essential ties with Finland during the tax years concerned (the 3-year rule).</p>

               <p>Finland is a party to the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2_91_eng_1990_tt">Arbitration Convention (90/436)</extxref>, which provides that where the commercial or financial relations between two associated enterprises differ from those which would apply between independent enterprises, the profits of those enterprises should each be adjusted as appropriate to reflect the arm’s length position. The Arbitration Convention (90/436) provides for disputes with fiscal authorities to be referred to an advisory commission, subject to waiver of rights of appeal under domestic law provisions. The Arbitration Convention (90/436) was first applicable with respect to the 15 old EU Member States. With respect to the 10 new EU Member States that acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004, a new Accession Convention was signed on 8 December 2004. The Arbitration Convention (90/436) entered into force in relation to Bulgaria and Romania on 1 July 2008 and in relation to Croatia on 1 January 2015.</p>

               <title>The Nordic Conventions</title>
               <p>The Nordic countries (i.e. Denmark, including Greenland and the Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) have a long history of legislative co-operation and share a social and cultural background. This has enabled them to conclude multilateral agreements with each other in various fields. It differs, however, from one agreement to another which countries have concluded the agreement in question. Another factor affecting the applicability of the Nordic Conventions is that only Denmark, Sweden and Finland belong to the European Union. However, Norway and Iceland are part of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_eea">EEA</xref>.</p>
               <p>The relevant Nordic Conventions are listed below:</p>
               <p>The <emph type="i">Income and Capital Tax Treaty</emph> (signed on 23 September 1996, entered into force on 11 May 1997, and became effective from 1 January 1998) as amended by Protocols signed on 6 October 1997, 4 April 2008 and 29 August 2018. The treaty has been concluded by Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Greenland is not included in the treaty but has concluded separate tax treaties with Denmark, Iceland and Norway. Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden have signed on 29 August 2018 a new amending protocol to the Treaty, which became effective on 1 January 2020. The amending protocol implements the minimum standards as entailed in the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project and, hence:</p>
               <list>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>amends the preamble are modified to express the fact that the Treaty aims to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in the Treaty for the indirect benefit of residents of third states;</p>

               </list>
               <p>The <emph type="i">Inheritance and Gift Tax Treaty</emph> (signed on 12 September 1989, entered into force on 19 August 1992 and became effective from 18 October 1992). The treaty has been concluded between Denmark, Finland and Iceland. Sweden and Norway were also included in the Treaty, but Sweden terminated it with effect from 24 August 2007 and Norway with effect from 22 August 2014. In consequence, the Inheritance and Gift Tax Treaty is no longer effective for relevant transfers, etc. between Sweden/Norway and the other signatory states. The Inheritance and Gift Tax Treaty does not cover the Faroe Islands and Greenland.</p>
               <p>The <emph type="i">Nordic Social Security Agreement </emph>was signed on 12 June 2012 and entered into force with respect to Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden on 1 May 2014. The Agreement entered into force in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland on 1 May 2015. The entry into force dates are also the effective dates of the Agreement.</p>
               <p>The <emph type="i">Nordic Social Security Agreement</emph> was concluded in order to provide a wider personal coverage than that provided by the former EU Regulations (<extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2-is-li-no-ch_50_eng_1971_tt">Social Security Regulation (71/1408)</extxref> and <extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2-is-li-no-ch_50_eng_1972_tt">Social Security Regulation (72/574)</extxref>). Whereas the EU Social Security Regulations applied only to employed and self-employed persons and the family members of such persons, the Nordic Social Security Agreement extends to persons outside the labour market (e.g. students and pensioners). As the former EU Regulations have been replaced by the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2-is-li-no-ch_50_eng_2004_tt">Social Security Regulation (2004/883)</extxref> with effect from 1 May 2010, and this new Regulation covers, inter alia, all EU nationals, there was an overlap in the personal scope of the EU Regulation and the Nordic Social Security Agreement. Thus the former Nordic Social Security Agreement concluded on 18 August 2003 was replaced by a new one. The new agreement complements <extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2-is-li-no-ch_50_eng_2004_tt">Social Security Regulation (2004/883)</extxref> and extends its scope to also cover the Faroe Islands, Greenland and nationals of third countries residing in the Nordic countries. </p>
               <p>The <emph type="i">Mutual Assistance Treaty</emph> (signed on 7 December 1989, entered into force on 8 May 1991 and became effective on 9 May 1991). The treaty has been concluded by Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Iceland and Norway, and concerns provisions dealing with mutual administrative assistance in tax matters. The scope of the treaty is very wide: it covers not only national income and capital taxes and municipal taxes, but also inheritance and gift taxes, VAT, car taxes, excise duties and social security contributions. Article 2 of the treaty should be consulted for the detailed list of the taxes covered by the treaty with respect to each jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>The treaty enables automatic exchange of information between the contracting states, concerning individuals and legal entities in respect of, inter alia, credit balances with banks, payments of dividends, interest and royalties, and ownership of immovable property. Requests and documents regarding assistance may be drawn up in Danish, Norwegian or Swedish, or be accompanied by a translation into one of those languages.</p>

            <title>General</title>
            <p>Company and tax laws recognize three types of groups:</p>
            <list>
               <item label="(1)" spaceabove="0">
                  <p>for company law purposes (chapter 1, section 5 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_kpl">KPL</xref>), if a company holds a sufficient amount of the shares in another domestic or non-resident company, so that the holding represents more than 50% of the voting right or otherwise can exercise control, the former company is deemed to be a parent company and the latter a subsidiary;</p>
               </item>
               <item label="(2)" spaceabove="0">
                  <p>for group contribution purposes, the parent company must own directly, or through subsidiaries at any tier, at least 90% of the capital in a subsidiary (tax group); and</p>
               </item>
               <item label="(3)" spaceabove="0">
                  <p>for VAT purposes, companies in the financial or insurance sector can form a group (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_13.2.1.">13.2.1.</xref>).</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Only companies (and not, for example, partnerships) may be included in a tax group ((2) above). Generally only domestic companies may become members of a tax group. Non-resident companies may be, in certain cases, intermediate companies, but do not qualify as payers or recipients of group contribution except for their branch in Finland.</p>
            <p>A tax group has no minimum period of existence. However, the benefits available to a tax group may be obtained only if the necessary holding was achieved in the previous tax year (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_8.2.">8.2.</xref>). The existence of a qualifying ownership structure is reported in the tax return. There are no registration requirements for a tax group.</p>
            <p>The members of a tax group do not file consolidated tax returns and the taxable income of the members is not consolidated for tax purposes. The consolidation of taxable income is achieved by paying and receiving group contribution during the tax year from one company to another. Group contribution may be deducted by the paying company from its business income and is taxable income in the hands of the recipient.</p>
         </section>
         <section anchor="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_8.2." label="8.2.">
            <title>Consolidated income</title>
            <p>The concept of consolidated income tax return is unknown in Finnish tax law, although a group of companies for company law purposes is required to prepare a consolidated balance sheet. The same result may, however, be achieved through group contributions.</p>
            <p>According to the Group Contributions Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_konsavl">KonsAvL</xref>), contributions between resident companies may be deducted under the following conditions (sections 2-5, 7 of the KonsAvL):</p>

               <item label="-" spaceabove="0">
                  <p>the resident company (parent company) has owned, either directly or indirectly, during the entire tax year, at least 90% of the shares of another resident company (subsidiary);</p>

               <item label="-" spaceabove="0">
                  <p>the contribution is recorded in the annual accounts of both companies and affects their annual net income; and</p>
               </item>
               <item label="-" spaceabove="0">
                  <p>the contribution is not a mere capital investment.</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>With effect from 1 January 2021, the law has been extended to foreign companies that are treated as Finnish tax residents.</p>
            <p>Group contributions, subject to the conditions stated above, are allowable expenses for the paying company and part of the taxable income of the receiving company. A group contribution may not exceed the net taxable business income of the paying company and may not be part of losses to be carried forward for tax purposes by that company (sections 4, 6 of the KonsAvL).</p>
            <p>Allowable group contributions are ordinarily made between a parent company and its subsidiary. However, they may also be made between two resident subsidiaries. Although both the paying and receiving companies must carry on business activities and may not be mere passive entities, such as holding companies, indirect ownership through passive group companies is also considered when determining whether a qualifying 90% ownership exists.</p>
            <p>Under the Group Contributions Law, passive group companies must also be resident companies. However, several decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court have considered non-resident intermediate companies or even non-resident parent companies to qualify, when determining the minimum ownership, on the basis of non-discrimination provisions of the applicable tax treaty. Nevertheless, a payment of a group contribution to a non-resident subsidiary or to a non-resident parent company is not tax deductible.</p>
            <p>The ownership structure must be in force from the first day of the accounting period of both payer and recipient. This means that if shares in another company are acquired, group contribution is not an allowable expense during the acquisition year. Only if a subsidiary is a new company established during the accounting year is group contribution possible. Generally, the accounting year must end on the same date for both the payer and the recipient. If, for instance, a company is merged into another company during the accounting year, a group contribution is not possible between the companies in that tax year.</p>
            <p>The decision to pay a certain amount of group contribution must be recorded in the minutes of the paying company’s board meeting during the tax year. Necessary entries in the accounts of both payer and recipient must be made, at the latest, when the books for the accounting year are closed.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary to pay the group contribution in cash during the tax year or the following tax years. The group contribution receivable may be offset by reverse group contribution or by offsetting it against accounts payable in the recipient company.</p>
            <p>If the recipient has loss carry-forwards to be deducted from taxable income, and the deduction is only allowed on the basis of a special authorization granted by the tax office (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.8.1.">1.8.1.</xref>), group contribution received is not available to cover the loss carry-forwards.</p>
            <p>With effect from 1 January 2021, through the introduction of the Law on Deducting Final Loss of <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_eea">EEA</xref> Subsidiary (<emph type="i">Laki Euroopan talousalueella sijaitsevan tytäryhtiön lopullisen tappion konsernivähennyksestä</emph>; <emph type="i">Lag om ett tilläggsavdrag för forsknings- och utvecklingsverksamhet under skatteåren 2021–2025</emph>; <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_etatappiol">EtaTappioL</xref>), a resident parent company may deduct final losses of its subsidiaries that are resident in another EEA state. This is achieved by way of a special group deduction from its taxable income. The deduction is only granted if (i) the parent company holds at least 90% of the shares of the foreign subsidiary; and (ii) the subsidiary has been dissolved through liquidation. The group deduction the parent company may take corresponds to the final loss made by its EEA subsidiary but may not exceed the taxable profits of the parent company in the relevant year.</p>

            <p>The interim dividend is tax-free income for the parent company for the year in which the decision concerning the distribution of interim dividends is adopted. The possibility to use interim dividends also for tax purposes means that a dividend flow through to the ultimate parent company may be made during 1 year instead of having to wait for dividends to be distributed the following year from adopted financial statements. The interim dividends may be used, for instance, in situations where a group contribution (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_8.2.">8.2.</xref>) is not possible (e.g. by financial institutions or if the conditions for a group contribution are otherwise not satisfied).</p>

However, if another group company has previously suffered a tax-deductible loss in connection with the sale of the shares that the other group company transfers forward tax exempt, the part of the capital gain corresponding to the earlier loss is taxable income in the hands of the second transferor.</p>
            <p>In addition, share exchanges may be carried out without triggering the taxation of capital gain (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_9.3.">9.3.</xref>).</p>

            <p>If a company is sold or otherwise disposed of in such a way that the ownership and other requirements for the group contributions are not met, it may not give or receive a group contribution during the relevant accounting period. A sale or other disposal of one group company may also prevent group contributions between the remaining group members if the disposed company was in a passive position required for the group contribution, <emph type="i">see</emph> sections <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_8.1.">8.1.</xref> and <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_8.2.">8.2.</xref> </p>

               <p>The Company Law and the Business Income Tax Law provide for two basic types of tax-neutral company mergers, variations of which may be devised (chapter 16, section 2 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_oyl_2">OYL</xref>; sections 52a and 52b of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). In all mergers, at least one of the companies will cease to exist. According to section 52a of the EVL a merger means an operation whereby:</p>
               <list>
                  <item label="-" spaceabove="0">
                     <p>one or more companies, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfer all their assets and liabilities to another company in exchange for the issue of new or existing shares to their shareholders representing the capital of that other company, and, if applicable, a cash payment not exceeding 10% of the nominal value, or, in the absence of a nominal value, of the accounting par value of those shares;</p>
                  </item>
                  <item label="-" spaceabove="0">
                     <p>a company, on being dissolved without going into liquidation, transfers all its assets and liabilities to the company holding all the securities representing its capital to a company owned by the latter company.</p>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The acquiring company and the absorbed company are treated separately for tax purposes until the merger is registered in the trade register (section 52b of the EVL). Consequently, a company that is absorbed must prepare annual accounts and file a tax return for the period ending on the registration date, which becomes the official date of merger.</p>
               <p>A merger is treated as a general succession. When companies merge, the assets and liabilities of the absorbed company are treated for tax purposes in the same manner by the acquiring company. For example, inventory and fixed assets are taken over by the acquiring company at the values shown in the books of the absorbed company. Deductible expenses are set off against income for the acquiring company in the same manner as for the absorbed company. The losses of the absorbed company are carried forward, provided that the combined holdings of the acquiring company and its shareholders have, since the beginning of the loss year, exceeded 50% of the shares in the absorbed company. The imputation tax credit of the absorbed company is also carried forward, provided that the combined holdings of the acquiring company and its shareholders have, since the beginning of the loss year, exceeded 50% of the shares in the absorbed company.</p>
               <p>Profits resulting from a merger are not taxable and losses are not deductible by the merged companies (sections 52a and 52b of the EVL). Taxation is deferred until the assets are sold or assigned by the acquiring company. A merger qualifies for a tax exemption (or deferral) even if the shares (assets) of the absorbed company are exchanged, in addition to shares of the acquiring company, for cash. However, the cash consideration may not exceed 10% of the nominal value of the shares of the acquiring company (section 52a of the EVL).</p>
               <p>Divisions qualify for special tax treatment under the Business Income Tax Law (section 52c of the EVL). The current law provides for two kinds of tax-neutral divisions, i.e. the complete division and the partial division. The <emph type="i">complete division</emph> is a transaction in which one company transfers, without being dissolved, its entire business (assets and liabilities) to two or more existing or newly created companies for newly issued or existing shares in such companies for pro rata issue to its shareholders of shares representing the capital of the companies receiving the assets and liabilities. For purposes of the EVL, divisions are recognized even if the shares (assets) of the divided company are exchanged, in addition to newly issued or existing shares of the acquiring or receiving companies, for cash. However, the cash consideration may not exceed 10% of the nominal value, or in absence of a nominal value, of the accounting par value of the newly issued or existing shares of the acquiring company or companies (section 52c of the EVL). The <emph type="i">partial division</emph> is a transaction in which the company undergoing a division will retain at least one business and one or more independent businesses will be transferred to a company that will continue those businesses.</p>
               <p>The tax treatment of divisions is the same as that for mergers. The assets, liabilities, reserves, losses, etc. of the divided company are treated for tax purposes in the same manner by the acquiring companies as they would have been treated by the divided company. Taxation is deferred until the assets of the divided company are alienated by the acquiring company or companies. The acquiring companies, in principle, share in the reserves, book values of fixed assets, losses, unused imputation credits, etc. of the divided company that may not be attributed clearly to a certain branch of activity or certain assets, in the same proportion that they share in the net property of the divided company.</p>
               <p>The tax provisions governing mergers and divisions also apply where they are implemented between companies that reside in different EU Member States. The special provisions for tax exemption of mergers and divisions do not apply if the sole or principal purpose of the merger or division is tax avoidance (section 52g of the EVL).</p>
               <p>For purposes of the transfer tax, the transfer of immovable property and securities in connection with a merger or a division has been deemed not to constitute a taxable transaction (sections 4, 15 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vsvl">VSVL</xref>).</p>

               <title>Shareholders</title>
               <p>In general, there are no tax consequences to shareholders of companies involved in a merger or division, as long as the merger or division qualifies for tax-free treatment under Finnish law. The consideration paid to the shareholders of the alienating company need not consist exclusively of newly issued or existing shares of the acquiring company or companies: up to 10% of the consideration may be paid in cash. To the extent that cash is paid, the shares of the alienating company are deemed to have been sold for tax purposes (sections 52b, 52c of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>).</p>
               <p>An exchange of shares in a merger or division for newly issued shares of the acquiring company or companies is not regarded as a disposal for purposes of capital gains tax. Capital gains taxation is deferred until the shares acquired in the exchange are sold (sections 52b, 52c of the EVL).</p>

               <p>Tax law recognizes tax-neutral share exchanges. An exchange of shares is a transaction in which a company (acquirer) purchases shares of another company (target) and ends up with more than 50% of the voting power of the target, provided at least 90% of the consideration paid to the target’s shareholders consists of newly issued or existing shares of the acquirer. This means that no more than 10% of the consideration may be paid in cash (section 52f of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). To the extent that the consideration consists of shares of the acquirer, the exchange of shares is not deemed to be a taxable transaction either to the company or its shareholders.</p>
               <p>The special provisions that provide for the tax-free treatment of share exchanges do not apply if the sole or principal purpose of the exchange is tax avoidance (section 52g of the EVL).</p>

               <p>The exchange of shares is not deemed to be a taxable transaction and does not trigger capital gains taxation (of the shareholders who give up their shares) if the cash consideration does not exceed 10% of the nominal value of the newly issued shares. To the extent that cash is paid, the shares alienated in the transaction are deemed to have been sold for tax purposes (section 52f of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>) and the capital gain is subject to tax.</p>
               <p>If the shares received in the exchange are sold, the acquisition value of the shares for the purposes of capital gains tax is the tax value of the original shares. If a shareholder of the other company receiving shares of the purchasing company becomes, within 3 full calendar years after the exchange, resident in another country under the Finnish domestic law or tax treaty, any untaxed gain becomes taxable in the hands of the shareholder.</p>

Under section 52d of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>, a transfer of assets is a transaction in which a company transfers either all its assets, liabilities and reserves or those relating to one or more of its independent branches of activities, to an existing or newly created company in exchange for newly issued or existing shares of the latter. The receiving company must continue the business that is transferred to it, but the transferring company need not necessarily continue its business.</p>
            <p>A transfer of assets is tax neutral. For the seller, the transfer price is the tax book value and the transferee continues with the same values in its taxation. Tax-free treatment does not apply, however, if the sole or principal purpose of the reorganization is tax avoidance (section 52g of the EVL).</p>
            <p>If, in connection with the transfer of a business, immovable property or securities of the transferring company are transferred to the company continuing the business and the latter paid transfer tax, it may, upon application within 3 years, obtain a refund of the tax (section 43 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vsvl">VSVL</xref>).</p>

               <p>When a company is liquidated, the company is deemed, for the purpose of taxation of the company itself, to have sold its inventory, fixed and other assets at fair market value. In other words, the company is taxed on fictitious capital gains equal to the difference between the book value and the market value of the assets at the moment of liquidation (section 51d of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). Generally, only immovable property and securities may have a market value that is above the current book value of the assets. No deemed goodwill value, e.g. on business relations, customer lists or market know-how, is evaluated and taxed at the liquidation.</p>

            <p>The tax authorities and tax courts apply the principle of substance over form as stated in the tax legislation (e.g. section 28 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>). If they conclude that there is no or not an adequate business reason underlying a transaction between group companies, or if they believe that a transaction is given a legal form which does not correspond to its actual character, they consider the transaction to be void for tax purposes and tax it as if the real form had been used. For company law and for other legal purposes, the transaction in its original form may still be valid.</p>
            <p>If it is clear that a company has paid, as salary, housing benefit, entertainment, insurance etc. to its shareholder more than the amount that would have been reasonable, or if the company pays the shareholder interest, lease payments, commissions and the like, in an amount which exceeds that ordinarily paid by the company to third parties, tax is assessed on the amount which the tax authorities and courts deem to be in excess of the reasonable amount. The income stipulated by this tax rule in the Law on Tax Procedure is called hidden profit distribution. For the tax treatment, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_6.1.5.">6.1.5.</xref> </p>
            <p>If the tax authorities conclude, based on section 31 of the VML, that the arm’s length principle has not been observed in transactions between group companies, the taxation may be corrected and reassessment may be made to reflect the arm’s length conditions. Subsidiaries and branches of non-resident companies are treated as companies owned by residents.</p>

               <p>With effect from 1 January 2022, section 31 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref> has been amended to allow for non-recognition of a controlled transaction between related parties or to disregard it according to the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_oecd">OECD Guidelines</xref>.</p>
               <p>If, in a transaction between a taxable person and a related party, terms or conditions differ from those which would have been agreed between independent parties and the taxable income related to the taxable person’s business or other activities has been reduced (or the loss has been higher than it would otherwise have been), the amount that would have accrued if the terms corresponded to what would have been agreed between the independent parties will be added to the taxable income of the taxable person.</p>
               <p>When assessing, in accordance with the arm’s length principle, whether terms or conditions agreed or imposed in a controlled transaction differ from those which would be agreed on in an uncontrolled transaction, the relevant commercial or financial relations and the economically relevant characteristics affecting those relations are identified. These include contractual terms, functions, assets and risks of the parties, characteristics of the property or service, economic circumstances of the markets and parties and their business strategies. The transaction will be determined based on these characteristics.</p>
               <p>If, in exceptional circumstances, a related-party transaction differs from what would have been agreed between economically sound independent parties in similar circumstances, it may be disregarded and, if necessary, replaced by another arm’s length transaction. </p>
               <p>The parties to a transaction are related if one party to the transaction has control over the other party, or in case the third party, alone or together with its related parties, has control over both parties to the transaction. A party has control over the other party when:</p>

                  <title>Country-by-country reporting</title>
                  <p>Country-by-country (CbC) reporting applies to resident taxpayers and to permanent establishments of non-resident entities that are members of multinational enterprises (MNEs) with a global turnover of EUR 750 million during the preceding tax year. </p>
                  <p>The CbC report must be filed within 12 months from the end of the relevant tax year. The data to be included corresponds to the data listed in OECD BEPS Action 13 and Annex 3 of the Final Report. If the tax administration does not receive the relevant data through the information-sharing mechanism, the taxpayer is required to provide such data. However, the resident taxpayer that is not the ultimate or the surrogate parent entity in the MNE group is only required to provide the data at its disposal. On 30 June 2021, the tax administration published updated instructions, VH/3086/00.01.00/2021, online at <url target="http://www.vero.fi">www.vero.fi</url>.</p>
                  <p>The taxpayers are required to provide the name, address and tax identity code of the reporting MNE and the country to which the report is given by the end of the accounting period or tax year that will be reported. However, regarding tax year 2016, the information must have been provided by the end of May 2017.</p>
                  <p>The reports must be filed electronically.</p>
                  <p>If the taxpayer has not filed the CbC report on time or if it is essentially incomplete or erroneous, or if the taxpayer has not notified the tax administration of the reporting MNE, as well as in the case of its refusal to provide the required information, the tax administration may impose a tax penalty of up to EUR 25,000.</p>

               <title>Transfer pricing methods and practice</title>
               <p>According to section 14b(2)7k of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vml">VML</xref>, a company must describe the transfer pricing method and its application (a financial analysis). There is no other reference in the tax law to the permitted transfer pricing methods. Hence, the matter is ultimately left to case law. The case law on methods is sparse but one should expect a total valuation of the case and its merits.</p>
               <p>In the updated statement VH/1189/00.01.00/2021 of 21 April 2021, the tax administration endorses the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and tax administrations (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_oecd">OECD Guidelines</xref>), and states that they will be used as guidance when interpreting the arm’s length principle in section 31 of the VML. They will also be used in the assessment of cases from prior years provided that the updated texts of the OECD Reports are not in fundamental conflict with the OECD Guidelines applicable at the time of filing of the relevant tax return, nor in conflict with the taxation practice and case law that prevailed during the relevant tax year.</p>
               <p>The updated instructions VH/44/00.01.00/2022 of 28 April 2022 (currently in Finnish and Swedish only), issued by the tax administration, endorse the methods under the OECD Guidelines and discuss the most appropriate one in more detail. </p>
               <p>There are several recent decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court (KHO), which give guidance on the interpretation of the OECD Guidelines (e.g. KHO 2013:36, KHO 2014:119, KHO 2017:146, KHO 2018:173, KHO 2020:34, KHO 2020:35, KHO 2021:73 and KHO 2021:127). </p>

               <p>Economic double taxation caused by a transfer pricing adjustment can be mitigated under Finland’s income tax treaties that contain a provision similar to article 9(2) of the OECD Model or other appropriately worded provisions. Within the European Union, cases of economic double taxation caused by a transfer pricing adjustment can also be dealt with under the Arbitration Convention (90/436). The Arbitration Convention (90/436) was first applicable with respect to the 15 old Member States. With respect to the 10 EU Member States that acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004, a new Accession Convention was signed on 8 December 2004 (EU Official Journal, C 160, 30 June 2005) and implemented in Finland by means of Law 411/2006, effective from 1 September 2006. The Arbitration Convention (90/436) entered into force in relation to Bulgaria and Romania on 1 July 2008.</p>

            <p>There are no official thin capitalization rules. For the general limitation on the deductibility of interest expenses, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.4.5.">1.4.5.</xref> </p>
            <p>A general limitation on the deductibility of interest expenses between related parties applies (section 18a of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>). Section 18a of the EVL was revised with effect from 1 January 2019 due to implementation of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (2016/1164) (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_atad">ATAD</xref>). Among other changes, the costs of obtaining financing were added to the definition of interest expenses.</p>
            <p>The general limitation applies to directly or indirectly related companies or general and limited partnerships, resident in Finland or abroad. Companies and general and limited partnerships which are “independent”, i.e. which are not part of a consolidated group or affiliated to one, are exempted from the application of the revised provisions. The limitation does not apply to financial, insurance and pension institutions. In addition, (i) loans to finance long-term infrastructure investments, (ii) financial companies and (iii) corporate entities are exempted from the scope of the limitations subject to requirements stated in section 18b of the EVL. Examples of such long-term infrastructure investments include construction of public housing, and with effect from 1 January 2022 onwards, construction of roads, railways, waterways, and provision of public services.</p>
            <p>Interest expenses are, however, deductible up to the amount of interest income (section 18a of the EVL).</p>
            <p>Furthermore, a safe harbour rule applies, under which net interest expenses exceeding interest income are deductible up to EUR 500,000.</p>
            <p>Net interest expenses on loans between related parties exceeding EUR 500,000 are deductible up to a maximum of 25% of earnings before interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization for tax purposes, but after received group relief (adjusted EBITDA for tax purposes). For the calculation of the threshold of EUR 500,000, both related- and third-party interest expenses are taken into account. Where the net interest expenses exceed EUR 500,000, the limitation applies to the entire amount of these expenses.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of interest deduction limitation, parties are treated as related if one party has direct or indirect control over the other party or if a third party has control over both parties. The direct or indirect ownership or control limitation was reduced from 50% to 10% of the share capital or voting power over the other party with effect from 1 January 2022 onwards.</p>
            <p>A loan from a third party is treated as a loan from a related party if:</p>
            <list>
               <item label="-">
                  <p>a related party has a receivable from a third party and the receivable is connected to the loan; or</p>

               <item label="-">
                  <p>a receivable of a related party serves as a pledge for the third-party loan.</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>An interest payment, even if treated as non-deductible for the debtor, is treated as taxable interest income for the resident or non-resident creditor.</p>
            <p>The above-mentioned rules on interest deductibility do not apply if the entity can demonstrate that its equity-to-balance-sheet ratio is equal to or higher than the corresponding ratio of the adopted audited consolidated group balance sheet which has been prepared in either an EU/<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_eea">EEA</xref> state or a country with which Finland has a tax treaty. The balance sheets subject to comparison must be prepared using the same accounting principles and they must have been audited as of tax year 2022 onwards.</p>
            <p>With effect from 1 January 2019, the general limitation on the deductibility of interest expense is extended to cover also interest on loans from unrelated parties (companies or general and limited partnerships). The same rules as in the case of interest expense on loans between related parties apply, except that under the safe harbour rule, for loans from unrelated parties, interest expense is deductible up to EUR 3 million. However, the limitation does not apply to: (i) loans concluded before 17 June 2016 even if the underlying money transfer was made at a later stage; and (ii) interest expenses included in the depreciation and amortization costs before 1 January 2019 (section 18a of the EVL).</p>
            <p>Non-deductible net interest expenses may be carried forward indefinitely.</p>
            <p>It is possible to file an appeal concerning the amount of non-deductible net interest expenses.</p>
            <p>The deductibility of interest may not be denied in a discriminatory manner, provided there is an income tax treaty in force between the creditor’s country and Finland and if it contains a relevant non-discrimination rule.</p>
            <p>Interest paid on a subordinated loan the purpose of which is to strengthen the equity position of the borrower is deductible when recorded in the accounts.</p>

The amended Law applies to tax years or accounting periods, which end on or after 1 January 2019.</p>
            <p>According to the CFC Law, a resident taxpayer (company, individual or a partnership), who is a shareholder or a beneficiary of a non-resident corporate entity (alone or through related entities or individuals), is taxed on the income of the non-resident entity regardless of whether or not the income is distributed to the taxpayer if:</p>

            </list>
            <p>The CFC Law applies to non-resident taxpayers only if the CFC income earned by a non-resident relates to a permanent establishment, which the non-resident according to Finnish domestic law has in Finland.</p>

            <p>In calculating the income on the basis of which it is determined whether the effective rate of tax is less than three fifths of the Finnish tax rate, dividends received by the CFC from another CFC are not taken into account, provided the dividends are distributed from profits that, during the 5 previous years, have been included in the tax base in determining the effective rate of tax (section 2 of the CFC Law).</p>

            <p>There are no special tax provisions that are targeted at holding companies. However, the tax treatment of a holding company depends in part on whether the holding company is deemed to be carrying on a business. The different tax treatment of holding companies and companies carrying out business activities is due to special provisions in various laws and to the fact that income resulting from business activities is subject to tax under the Business Income Tax Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_evl">EVL</xref>) and other income is taxed under the general Income Tax Law (<xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tvl">TVL</xref>).</p>

Every partnership is, however, required to file an annual tax return and the taxable income of a partnership is computed in general in the same manner as that of a company. However, partnerships do not themselves pay income taxes. The income of the partnership is considered to pass to each partner and the latter is assessed on his share of the partnership’s income, regardless of whether or not it is actually distributed to him.</p>
            <p>Each partner is required to report in his tax return his share of the partnership’s income, as well as any salary, interest or other remuneration received from the partnership. The distribution of the partnership’s profits does not trigger additional taxable income in the hands of the partners because that income has already been taxed at the partner level at the time it was earned by the partnership.</p>
            <p>Individuals who are partners pay tax at the rate of 30% (34% on income exceeding EUR 30,000) on the income allocated to them from the partnership to the extent that the allocated income does not exceed 20% annual yield computed on the net worth of the partnership (section 40 of the TVL). The rest of the income is taxed at ordinary progressive tax rates.</p>
            <p>Losses of general and limited partnerships are deducted on the partnership level and may not be deducted from other income of the partners.</p>

            <p>Apart from resident companies that are effectively managed from Finland, Finnish permanent establishments of international shipping companies resident in other EU Member States qualify for the regime. In addition to ships owned and operated by the company itself, ships held or chartered out on bareboat or time charter basis qualify. However, at least 20% of the gross tonnage of the shipping company must consist of vessels by which the shipping company itself exercises passenger traffic and carries freight. In addition, there are certain conditions as to the composition of the company’s fleet aiming at preventing that companies not genuinely operating in/from Finland be granted the benefits of the regime (section 2).</p>
            <p>It is irrelevant whether the ship is actually operated on each day. As the regime applies also to ships chartered out to be operated by another resident company, the same vessel may become subject to the tonnage tax simultaneously twice. The regime allows no deductions, and depreciation does not affect the tonnage tax.</p>
            <p>The tonnage tax regime applies only to income pertaining to international transport of goods and passengers and activities directly relating thereto. Any other income of the shipping company, such as from sales to passengers of goods not to be consumed on board the ship, is subject to ordinary corporate income tax assessment (section 7). </p>
            <p>Under the regime applicable before 1 March 2012, income subject to the tonnage tax was exempt from ordinary taxation until distributed.</p>

            <p>The province of Åland’s status as a third country was confirmed by a special law which entered into force on 1 March 1997. Although it has a special status, Åland is considered to be a part of Finland and Finnish VAT laws apply in that province.</p>
            <p>As the VAT system imposes significant burdens on registered entrepreneurs, the law allows taxpayers to obtain advance rulings on VAT matters from tax offices, and in more important cases, from the Central Tax Board (<emph type="i">Keskusverolautakunta</emph>). In addition, a person engaged in or planning to engage in an activity which may entail VAT liability may apply for an advance ruling. Advance rulings concerning customs duties are issued by the Customs authorities (<emph type="i">Tulli</emph>).</p>
            <p>The application for an advance ruling must concern a specific, non-theoretical matter. An advance ruling is binding on the tax authorities for a fixed period of time.</p>
            <p>Advance rulings may, subject to the restrictions discussed in section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_1.11.3.">1.11.3.</xref>, be appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court.

               <p>Private persons may be deemed to be taxable persons with respect to acquisitions of new means of transport and, if they so elect, letting out of buildings and land.</p>
               <p>The state and municipalities are taxable on their supplies of goods and services in connection with their business activities, but not in their capacity as public bodies.</p>
               <p>The public health care, social welfare and rescue services will be reformed in Finland. The responsibility for organizing these services will be transferred from municipalities to well-being service counties with effect from 1 January 2023. The city of Helsinki as well as the Åland islands will organize their own health, social and rescue services. Well-being service counties shall have equal VAT treatment with the municipalities when providing supplies of goods or services or when buying those.</p>
               <p>Registered entrepreneurs are subject to VAT on self-supply (i.e. the entrepreneur takes goods or services from his business for private use or uses them for purposes other than his taxable business). The self-supply of a service is, however, subject to VAT only if the entrepreneur has purchased the service from a third party or he provides a similar service to customers and if the service is rendered in connection with the entrepreneur’s taxable business. A <emph type="i">de minimis</emph> rule applies to taxation of self-supply (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s22a">section 22a of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
               <p>However, there are many exceptions to these general rules. For instance, if a non-resident entrepreneur supplying goods or services in Finland does not have a fixed establishment in Finland, it is normally the customer (if he is registered for VAT in Finland) who is responsible for paying VAT (reverse charge or reverse tax liability). Small businesses, i.e. businesses whose turnover does not exceed EUR 15,000 (EUR 10,000 before 2021), non-profit organizations, religious communities and disabled persons, subject to certain conditions, are exempt from VAT. For details on these exemptions, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_13.8.">13.8.</xref>
               </p>
               <p>Small businesses, non-profit organizations, religious communities, disabled persons and landlords who rent out immovable property may, upon application, opt to be subject to VAT, if they carry on a business which, but for the exemption, would be taxable (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s12">sections 12</extxref> and <extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s30">30 of the AVL</extxref>). Although this renders their sales subject to VAT, they are able to deduct the input VAT charged on their purchases.</p>
               <p>All entrepreneurs subject to VAT are registered with the tax offices. This registration requirement (as well as other obligations) also applies to non-resident entrepreneurs that have a fixed establishment in Finland or tax liability for other reasons (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_13.4.">13.4.</xref>).</p>

            <p>VAT is levied at all stages of the production and distribution chain on the basis of the value added to the goods and services at each stage. The supplier of goods and services is required to account for tax on all supplies made by him to his customers (output tax). However, he may deduct the tax charged on the supplies made to him by his suppliers (input tax) from the tax to be paid to the government. VAT is thus paid on the value added at each stage in the production and distribution chain. It is the ultimate consumer who bears the aggregate tax. As it is rolled over to the final consumer, VAT is not an element of cost for businesses in the production and distribution chain.</p>
            <p>Only transactions carried out, or deemed to have been carried out, and services rendered, or deemed to have been rendered, within Finland are subject to VAT. Exportation of goods is zero rated. However, supplies to other EU Member States are subject to special rules. For instance, distance sales to a private person in another Member State may render the Finnish seller liable for VAT in that other Member State. Furthermore, sales to a taxable person in another EU Member State are exempt from Finnish VAT if the seller can prove that the goods were transported to the other Member State and he has indicated the VAT identification number of the buyer on the invoice. The import of goods is also subject to VAT. VAT is imposed, regardless of whether the customer is a registered entrepreneur or a private person. However, special rules apply with respect to the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States (intra-Community acquisition).</p>

                  <title>Importation</title>
                  <p>Imported goods are subject to VAT, whether or not the importer is an entrepreneur registered for VAT. However, import of those goods which would have been exempt if sold in Finland, is exempt. Consequently, the import of, for example, certain types of sea-going vessels and aircraft, is exempt. In addition, the import of goods that originate from outside the European Union and are free from customs duty, is exempt. These include, for example, medicines for use in research, goods to be tested and goods imported for exhibitions.</p>
                  <p>A registered entrepreneur may deduct VAT paid on imports in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as VAT may be deducted on purchases made from local suppliers.</p>
                  <p>With effect from 1 March 1997, importation from the province of Åland to the mainland of Finland is a taxable import. Similarly, the import of goods from the mainland to Åland is a taxable import of goods to Åland. However, the supplies of newspapers and other periodicals that are published once a week or less frequently and are transported from Åland to the mainland of Finland are treated as domestic supplies of goods and are taxed accordingly for VAT purposes.</p>
                  <p>With effect from 1 January 2018, the tax administration administers the VAT paid by registered entrepreneurs on importation instead of the customs authorities (who continue to supervise importation and are responsible for criminal investigations). The customs authorities administer other importation than importation by registered entrepreneurs, e.g. importation by individuals. </p>
                  <p>With effect from 1 January 2018, Finland applies the postponed accounting system on importation. This implies that VAT may be reported and deducted in the VAT return of the tax period to which the importation relates (i.e. import VAT is not effectively paid because it is deductible as input VAT through the same return).</p>
                  <p>Under the One-Stop Shop (OSS) scheme, a distance sale of goods will also be deemed to take place in the European Union when the recipient of the goods is the importer (if the sale must be reported under the OSS scheme). This sale is taxed in Finland for VAT purposes if the transport of the goods ends in Finland. </p>

                  <p>Except for new means of transport, no Finnish VAT is due if the goods are purchased from another EU Member State and the purchaser is a private person.</p>

                  <title>Place of taxation of supplies of goods</title>
                  <p>The place of supply of goods is in Finland if the goods are located in the territory of Finland at the moment of the supply. When the goods are transported to the purchaser, the place of supply of goods is deemed to be in Finland if the goods are in Finland when the transportation begins. The place of supply of goods is in Finland also when the goods are outside the European Union at the moment transportation begins, provided that the supplier imports the goods to Finland for sale (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s63">section 63 of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
                  <p>Where goods are deemed to be supplied within Finland and the supplier is not resident or has not opted for VAT in Finland, the purchaser is liable to VAT based on the reverse charge mechanism (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s9">section 9 of the AVL</extxref>). This means that the liability to pay VAT is shifted to the purchaser. The purchaser may recover the same VAT, provided that the goods were acquired for such purposes as to give entitlement to input VAT recovery. VAT is not payable if the purchaser is the state of Finland. The foreign seller is, however, liable to VAT if the purchaser is another foreign company that does not have a fixed establishment in Finland and is not registered for VAT in Finland, or if the purchaser is a private person, or in cases of distance selling, or in cases of sale of passenger transportation services, or teaching, scientific services, cultural, entertainment, or sports events and other comparable services, and the services directly linked to these services.</p>
                  <p>The rules for distance sales changed with effect from 1 July 2021, when Finland adopted new rules based on the Amending Directive to the VAT Directive (2017/2455) and on the Amending Directive to the VAT Directive (2019/1995). </p>
                  <p>The OSS scheme regarding the sellers established outside the European Union and the equivalent scheme regarding the sellers established in the European Union covers also all the services other than telecommunications services, radio and TV broadcasting services and electronically supplied services sold to consumers. The OSS scheme is further expanded to also cover distance sales of goods within the Community regardless of the country of establishment of the distance seller. </p>
                  <p>Local distance sales thresholds determined by the Member States (including the Finnish threshold of EUR 35,000) were abolished with effect from 1 July 2021. The distance sale shall be taxed in Finland if the transport of the goods ends in Finland. To ease the administrative burden for small businesses that are established only in one Member State, the distance sales of goods within the European Union are taxed in the Member State from where the transport of goods begins, provided that the value of the telecommunications services, radio and TV broadcasting services and electronically supplied services supplied within the European Union and supplies of goods supplied within the European Union does not exceed EUR 10,000 in a calendar year. In Finland, when calculating this threshold, the value of telecommunications services, radio and TV broadcasting services and electronically supplied services is taken into account for the whole year of 2021 and the value of supplies of goods is taken into account only for the supplies provided after 1 July 2021.</p>
                  <p>Use of the OSS scheme is optional. This scheme applies to supplies of services and supplies of goods in business-to-consumer (B2C) situations, provided that the supplier does not have a domicile or a fixed establishment in the Member State of the consumer to whom the services or goods are sold. </p>
                  <p>The local reverse charge mechanism applies to supplies of metal waste and scrap if both the supplier and the customer are registered for VAT purposes in Finland. However, this does not apply if the customer or supplier is a private individual.</p>

                  <p>With effect from 1 January 2010, the place of supply rules for services have been amended. This follows the provisions of <extxref publish="n" target="evd_2008_-_2008-8-ec_place_of_supply">Amending Directive to the VAT Directive (2008/08)</extxref>. The main rule is that services supplied to businesses (business-to-business, B2B) are deemed to be rendered at the place where the customer is domiciled or has a fixed establishment. The reverse charge applies in the country of the customer.</p>
                  <p>The place of supply of services rendered to non-taxable persons (B2C) is the place where the service provider is domiciled or has a fixed establishment.</p>
                  <p>Special rules apply to services connected with immovable property, transportation services and services connected thereto, work on movable goods, hiring of means of transport, cultural and entertainment services, restaurant services, travel agency services, certain intangible services, radio and television broadcasting services, electronic services, telecommunications services, and intermediary services.</p>
                  <p>Services connected with immovable property are deemed to be supplied in Finland if the immovable property is situated in Finland.</p>
                  <p>In B2C situations, cultural and entertainment services are deemed to be supplied in Finland if the activities are physically carried out in Finland. In B2B scenarios, the place-related rule continues to apply to admission to cultural and entertainment events. Other cultural and entertainment services supplied to businesses are deemed to be supplied in Finland if the customer’s fixed establishment to where the services are supplied or his domicile is situated in Finland.</p>
                  <p>The place of supply of restaurant transactions and catering services is where the services are physically rendered.</p>
                  <p>Where work on movable goods is supplied to a non-taxable person (B2C), the place of supply is in Finland if the work is physically performed in Finland. Where such work is supplied to a taxable person (B2B), the main rule applies.</p>
                  <p>In respect of intangible services, the main place-of-supply rule applies to taxable persons (B2B). Intangible services supplied to non-taxable persons (B2C) resident in the European Union are deemed to be supplied in Finland if the service provider is domiciled or has a fixed establishment in Finland. Intangible services rendered to non-taxable persons (B2C) resident outside the territory of the European Union are excluded from the scope of the general B2C place-of-supply rule. Correspondingly, the place of supply is outside Finland if the intangible services are supplied to the consumer’s fixed establishment or domicile outside the territory of the European Union.</p>
                  <p>The place of supply of telecommunications, radio and television broadcasting and electronic services (TBE services) is the same as for intangible services in B2B situations. With effect from 1 January 2015, the place of supply of TBE services in B2C situations has changed, in line with the requirements of <extxref publish="n" target="evd_2008_-_2008-8-ec_place_of_supply">Amending Directive to the VAT Directive (2008/08)</extxref>. Accordingly, the place of supply of B2C TBE services is where the consumer is established. The service provider must, in principle, register for VAT purposes in each EU Member State in which final consumers are located. However, instead of such a registration, the taxable persons supplying TBE services were able to use a Mini One-Stop Shop (MOSS) scheme. With effect from 1 July 2021, the MOSS system was replaced by the One-Stop Shop (OSS) system, effectively expanding the prior system with the intra-Community distance sales of goods and services. The system applies to supplies of services and distance sales of goods within the European Union to consumers by businesses established or domiciled in the European Union (EU special scheme). The non-EU special scheme is available to businesses that are established outside of the European Union and supply services to consumers in the European Union. Both schemes are optional.</p>
                  <p>The place of supply of intermediary services rendered to non-taxable persons (B2C) is in Finland if the goods and services are supplied in Finland. If the intermediary services are supplied to taxable persons (B2B), the main place-of-supply rule applies.</p>
                  <p>Transport of goods on behalf of a non-taxable person (B2C) is deemed to be supplied in Finland if it is performed in Finland, or, in case of intra-Community transport, begins in Finland. The main place-of-supply rule applies to transport of goods on behalf of a taxable person (B2B).</p>
                  <p>In addition, certain rules apply to the hiring out of means of transport. For both taxable (B2B) and non-taxable persons (B2C), short-term hiring of means of transport (maximum period of 30 days for vehicles and 90 days for vessels) is deemed to be supplied at the place where the means of transport is actually put at the disposal of the customer. The same rule applies to long-term hiring of means of transport for taxable persons (B2B). The place of supply of long-term hiring of means of transport (other than pleasure boats) to non-taxable persons (B2C) is in Finland if the customer’s fixed establishment or domicile is in Finland. Long-term hiring of a pleasure boat is deemed to be rendered in Finland if the vessel is actually put at the disposal of the customer in Finland, where this service is actually provided by the supplier from his place of business or a fixed establishment situated in Finland.</p>

                  <p>The place of taxation of imports is Finland if the goods are in Finland when imported into the European Union, or if the customs arrangement ends when the goods are within Finland (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s86a">section 86a of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
                  <p>If the importer is not resident in Finland, the VAT paid on importation may be applied back from Finland as a refund provided that the importer does not have to register for VAT. The onward supply of goods in Finland is subject to the reverse charge mechanism if the purchaser is registered for VAT in Finland. Non-EU businesses may act as importers only by using an indirect representation (for example, a forwarding agent may act as an importer).</p>

                  <title>Place of taxation of intra-Community acquisitions</title>
                  <p>Intra-Community acquisition of goods is deemed to be in Finland if the goods to be transported to the purchaser are in Finland at the moment the transportation ends (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s63e">section 63e of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
                  <p>Intra-Community acquisition is also deemed to take place in Finland if the purchaser uses in the acquisition a VAT identification number obtained in Finland, and the transportation of goods began in another EU Member State, and the purchaser does not show that the intra-Community acquisition has been taxed, or he has reported the acquisition in the Member State in which the transportation of goods ended.</p>
                  <p>Triangulation occurs when three parties in three different EU Member States are involved in selling and purchasing the same goods. The goods are sent directly from the first supplier’s Member State to the one of the second purchaser of the goods. For example, A in Denmark sells goods to B in Sweden, who sells goods to C in Finland, and the goods are directly sent from Denmark to Finland, i.e. from A to C. In this example, B would, under the main rule, acquire the goods in Finland (the place where the transportation ends), and he would be required to register for VAT and at least report the acquisition in Finland. Certain simplification measures have been introduced within the European Union. According to these rules, an intermediate supplier (B) is not required to register for VAT purposes in Finland and fulfil the administrative formalities connected with the registration and reporting.</p>
                  <p>For the simplification to apply, certain formalities must be fulfilled. These formalities include that invoices are issued including certain information, and that the reporting is done correctly. For example, the invoice B issues must include B’s VAT identification number in Sweden and C’s VAT identification number in Finland. In addition, B (if in Finland) must include “triangulation” or another similar reference in the invoice. C must report the acquisition in Finland as an intra-Community acquisition, and B (if in Finland) must report the acquisition as a triangulation supply in the EC Sales List. There may be differences in the application of the triangulation rules in various EU Member States.</p>

            <p>VAT becomes payable at the time the goods are delivered or services rendered, or goods or services have been put into use. The liability to pay VAT on importation of goods arises when the goods are released from Customs supervision (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s15">sections 15 and 16 of the AVL</extxref>). The sales are attributed to the month during which the liability to pay VAT has arisen.</p>
            <p>For advance payments, the time of taxation is when the payments are made to the seller, to the seller’s account, or otherwise.</p>
            <p>During the accounting period the supplier may also pay VAT based on the invoices issued. However, during the last month of the accounting period the supplier must pay VAT on all goods delivered or services rendered even though invoices have not yet been issued.</p>
            <p>Cash accounting is available to farmers and other taxable persons who are not required to comply with the obligations under the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_kpl">KPL</xref> and have the right to make a financial statement on a payment basis.</p>
            <p>With effect from 1 January 2017, optional cash accounting is also available to small businesses whose turnover does not exceed EUR 500,000 during an accounting year. The option only applies if the place of supply is in Finland. The optional cash accounting may not be applied to imports or exports of goods, intra-Community supplies of goods or cross-border supplies of services subject to the reverse charge. If a taxable person opts to apply cash accounting, he must apply it both to his supplies and to his purchases. The VAT liability for the cases where no payment is made for the supplies or purchases of goods or services may be deferred by a maximum of 12 months from the time of supply of the goods or the services.</p>
            <p>With effect from 1 January 2018, the postponed accounting system applies as regards importation (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_s_13.3.2.">13.3.2.</xref>).</p>
            <p>The Amending Directive to the VAT Directive (2016/1065) has been transposed into the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_avl">AVL</xref> with effect from 1 January 2019 (sections 18c, 18d and 73f of the AVL).</p>
            <p>A voucher is defined as an instrument where there is an obligation to accept it as a consideration or a part consideration for a supply of goods or services and where the goods or services to be supplied or the identities of their potential suppliers are either indicated on the voucher itself or in related documentation such as the terms and conditions of use of such instrument.</p>
            <p>The VAT treatment of the vouchers depends on whether they qualify as “single-purpose” vouchers or “multiple-purpose” vouchers.</p>
            <p>A single-purpose voucher is a voucher where the place of supply of the goods or services to which the voucher relates, and the VAT due on those goods or services are known at the time of issuance of the voucher. </p>
            <p>Multi-purpose voucher is defined negatively, i.e. as a voucher, other than a single-purpose voucher.</p>
            <p>Single-purpose voucher is comparable to an advance payment for the goods or services purchased. VAT is due at the moment of payment for the voucher. </p>
            <p>In the case of supply of multi-purpose vouchers, VAT is due at the moment the voucher is used for payment for the goods or services purchased.</p>
            <p>A stamp is not considered a voucher.</p>
            <p>With effect from 1 January 2020, in accordance with the provisions of Amending Directive to the <extxref publish="n"

The transfer by a taxable person of goods forming part of his business assets to Finland under call-off-stock arrangement will not be treated as a supply of goods for consideration.

               </item>
               <item label="(4)">
                  <p>the seller records the transfer of the goods in the register (section 209s of the AVL) and includes the identity of the buyer and the VAT identification number assigned to him by Finland in the recapitulative statement (section 162(2)(4) of the AVL).</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>When the conditions apply at the time of the transfer of the right to dispose of the goods as owner to the taxable person (purchaser in Finland), a supply of goods shall be deemed to be made by the seller and an intra-EU acquisition of goods shall be deemed to be made by the buyer provided that the goods are taken from the stock within 12 months. If the goods are not supplied within 12 months, a transfer shall be deemed to take place on the day following the expiry of the 12-months period.</p>
            <p>The goods are deemed to be supplied before the 12-months period if the goods are supplied to a person other than the taxable person to whom the goods were initially meant to be supplied to or if the goods are dispatched or transported to a country other than Finland, as well as in the event of the destruction, loss or theft of the goods.</p>
            <p>With effect from 1 January 2020, under the call-off stock arrangements, the supplier must indicate in the recapitulative statement the VAT number of the intended buyer. There is a special form for that purpose, which will be enclosed with the recapitulative statement.</p>

            <p>VAT is levied on the sales price of taxable goods and services, excluding the amount of the VAT itself. The taxable amount includes all surcharges. On the other hand, the entrepreneur may deduct, inter alia, bad debts (relating to receivables for which VAT has already been paid) and discounts, including discounts allowed to the client after delivery.</p>
            <p>In the case of imported goods, VAT is levied on the value of goods for customs duty purposes, including customs duty and any other national tax or charge other than VAT (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s88">sections 88 to 93 of the AVL</extxref>), including transport costs, regardless of whether the importer is a registered entrepreneur and whether the goods are intended for resale or are merely intended for private use. Consequently, the taxable amount includes, for example, packing, freight, loading, unloading and insurance expenses, regardless of whether these costs are included in the total price or are charged separately. The taxable amount of a standard computer programme includes both the value of the programme and the hard copy.</p>
            <p>The taxable amount of goods which have been outside the European Union for repairs, completion or processing, is the value added abroad, including transport costs (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s90">sections 90 and 91 of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
            <p>For goods that are taken from the entrepreneur’s taxable business for the entrepreneur’s private use or that are taken to be used for purposes that do not allow VAT deduction, the taxable amount is the purchase price or market value, whichever is lower. In the case of self-manufactured goods, however, the tax is accounted for on the direct and indirect manufacturing costs. Similar principles apply to the self-supply of services (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s74">sections 74 and 75 of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
            <p>Special rules apply to supplies made below the market value between related parties (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s73c">sections 73c, 73d and 73e of the AVL</extxref>). The basis for taxation is the market value if the consideration is considerably lower than the market value, the seller and the purchaser are related, and the purchaser does not have full recovery of the input VAT. In this context, “related” refers to family relationships, ownership relationships, employment relationships, or where the purchaser has control over the seller.</p>

            <p>There are a large number of exemptions from VAT and only those that are the most important for companies are discussed below.</p>
            <p>In general, if the sale of certain goods is exempt from VAT, the import of such goods is also exempt. In addition, the import of certain goods which are free from customs duties, safety devices used by foreign airlines, and documents and forms, is not subject to VAT (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s94">section 94 of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
            <p>There are two main classes of VAT exemption:</p>

               <p>VAT liability is initially computed by applying the appropriate tax rate to the tax base of the goods and services supplied in each month (output tax). In general, the method applied is the accrual basis. Accordingly, VAT is payable or deductible for the goods that have been delivered and the services that have been rendered during the month. However, VAT becomes payable when the seller receives consideration if this takes place prior to the supply. The taxable person may deduct from the amount of output tax the VAT paid by him on his purchases and imports during the same month (input tax), as long as these are connected with his supply of taxable or zero-rated goods and services and exports and the input tax is clearly indicated on a purchase invoice.</p>
               <p>To the extent the entrepreneur supplies goods or services which are exempt without input tax deduction, his right to a deduction of input tax is restricted on basis of the use.</p>
               <p>No deduction is allowed for VAT paid with respect to, inter alia, the following (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s114">sections 114 and 115 of the AVL</extxref>):</p>

               <p>According to the special regime applicable to second-hand goods, the seller of second-hand goods may apply the “profit margin” method on sales of second-hand goods acquired in Finland or from other EU Member States. Under the profit margin method, VAT is payable on the profit margin, which is the difference between the sale price and the purchase price of the goods. The seller of second-hand goods may opt for the application of these rules. If the profit margin method is applied, the invoice of the sale must include a statement that the profit margin method is applied, and that the selling price does not include any refundable VAT. The profit margin method also applies to works of art and collectors’ items and antiques in certain situations (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s79a">sections 79a to 79k of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
               <p>A non-resident entrepreneur who has no fixed establishment and no obligation to register due to his sales in Finland, and who has not registered voluntarily for VAT, but who has made taxable purchases from Finland for use in his business carried on abroad, may also apply for a VAT refund (refund according to EU <extxref publish="n" target="vatdir_2008_09_eng">VAT Refund Directive (2008/9)</extxref> or the <extxref publish="n" target="vatdir_1986_560_eng">Thirteenth Directive (86/560)</extxref>). However, no refund is granted to a non-resident entrepreneur engaged in intra-Community supplies or other zero-rated transactions in Finland if the non-resident entrepreneur has not registered for VAT purposes in Finland.</p>
               <p>An excess of input VAT is refunded monthly, unless it is used to cover other taxes or if the taxable person wishes to retain it in the account for future use. </p>

               <p>Input VAT may be recovered if incurred for taxable purposes. If the same taxable person has taxable and non-taxable activities, only the input VAT of the goods and the services that are acquired for taxable activities may be recovered. If the goods or services are purchased for non-taxable activities, the input VAT may not be recovered. If goods or services purchased are used for both taxable and non-taxable purposes, partial recovery is available. How the deductible proportion is determined depends on the business in question: sometimes the basis of turnover derived from taxable and non-taxable transactions may be appropriate, at other times, it may be more appropriate to use other factors, such as the time employees spend on taxable and non-taxable activities, or the actual use of the goods and services concerned.</p>

               <p>Rules exist regarding adjustment for real estate. During an adjustment period of 10 years, the input VAT recovery of construction works (investments) must be adjusted based on use, and changes in use. If there is a reduction in use for taxable purposes, a repayment of the corresponding part of the input VAT recovery must be made. Conversely, if there is an increase, the taxable person may recover more input VAT.</p>
               <p>The adjustment rules are applied only to construction works relating to new buildings or land, and to major renovation works of old buildings or land. Major renovation works are those that must be capitalized in the books of the person.</p>
               <p>Input VAT need not be adjusted if the real estate is sold and remains in taxable use, unless otherwise agreed. The purchaser will then continue to adjust the input VAT recovery as a successor for the seller of the real estate.</p>
               <p>For capital goods other than real estate, Finland does not apply a similar adjustment system.</p>

               <p>With effect from 1 January 2017, an online tax reporting portal, OMAVERO, was launched to replace the former tax account system.</p>
               <p>Small companies with turnover not exceeding EUR 100,000 may report and pay VAT on a quarterly basis. Small companies with turnover not exceeding EUR 30,000 may report and pay VAT on an annual basis.</p>
               <p>Taxable persons must file VAT returns no later than on the 12th day of the 2nd month following the relevant tax period. </p>
               <p>Neither annual VAT returns nor annual lists of suppliers and customers are required.</p>
               <p>Corrections to previously filed VAT returns may be made by filing a revised return, which must include an explanation of the change. However, small mistakes (i.e. where the amount of tax due is up to EUR 500) may be corrected in the next return and taxable persons do not have to make the correction for the earlier tax period to which the mistake belongs. In such cases, penalties for late payment do not apply. </p>
               <p>With effect from 1 January 2017, electronic filing of VAT returns is, in principle, compulsory. Filing on paper is permitted under special conditions. </p>
               <p>VAT returns must be accompanied by payment of the VAT due.</p>
               <p>Recapitulative statements (EC Sales Lists) relating to intra-Community supplies must be filed monthly (section 162e of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_avl">AVL</xref>). The statements are due on the 20th day of the month following the end of the reporting month. These statements must also include supplies of services to customers in other EU Member States that are liable to VAT based on the reverse charge mechanism. Services that are exempt from VAT in the country of taxation need not be reported. EC Sales Lists must be filed electronically. Filing on paper is allowed only under special conditions; for example, if electronic filing is not possible for technical reasons.</p>
               <p>In addition, taxable persons must file statistical information (Intrastat returns) to the Customs authorities with regard to intra-Community trade. Taxable persons whose annual acquisitions of goods from other Member States exceed EUR 700,000, and whose annual supplies exceed EUR 700,000, must submit monthly Intrastat returns. Monthly returns must be filed 10 days after the end of the previous calendar month. With effect from 1 May 2017, Intrastat returns must be submitted in electronic format.</p>
               <p>As part of the special COVID-19 pandemic tax measures, applicable under a law in force between 26 June 2020 and 31 August 2020, taxable persons could apply for refund of VAT remitted during the first quarter of 2020, within 30 days starting from 26 June 2020. The amounts refunded must be repaid to the tax authorities within 2 years with interest of 2.5%.</p>

                  <title>Rules from 1 January 2017</title>
                  <p>With effect from 1 January 2017, the revised rules regarding penalties apply. The penalty rules for self-assessed taxes (which include VAT) are defined in the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_oyl">OVML</xref>. On 16 January 2017, the tax administration issued guidance on the penalties (<emph type="i">Seuraamusmaksut oma-aloitteisessa verotuksessa</emph>, A18/200/2017). The revised rules are applied for tax periods beginning on 1 January 2017 or after that date, or when negligence has taken place on 1 January 2017 or after that date. The rules applicable before 1 January 2017, are applied for the tax periods that began before 1 January 2017 or if the negligence took place before that date.</p>
                  <p>The penalty for late filing applies if a VAT return is not filed on the due date. The amount of the penalty is EUR 3 per day (including weekends and holidays) and is calculated during a maximum of 45 days of delay (the total amount being EUR 135). If the tax return is late for more than 45 days, the penalty of EUR 135 is increased by 2% of the amount of the VAT due.</p>
                  <p>The original return may be corrected without penalties during 45 days following the filing date. If the return is corrected after that, the penalty fee is 2% of the amount of the VAT paid after the due date.</p>
                  <p>Omission or late payment of VAT also attracts a penalty. The tax administration assesses the tax that is not paid on time and imposes the penalty, which is a percentage of the VAT assessed. The amount of the penalty depends on the negligence or on the nature of the mistake. As a main rule, the penalty is 10% of the VAT assessed. However, the penalty is between 15% and 50% if the negligence continues or the taxable person disregards his obligation to pay VAT.</p>
                  <p>In the case where a taxpayer fails to assess his VAT liability, the tax authorities estimate the VAT due and apply the penalty of 25% of that amount.</p>
                  <p>When the relevant VAT issue is ambiguous or unclear, the penalty is 3%. The penalty may also be 3% when it would be unreasonable to impose the regular 10% penalty, e.g. if the taxpayer's mistake is minor and unintentional.</p>
                  <p>The tax authorities impose a penalty of up to EUR 200 when the taxable person has not fulfilled his responsibility to report information that does not affect the amount of VAT.</p>
                  <p>A penalty for negligence may be imposed when the negligence does not relate to the reporting of VAT. The maximum amount of the penalty is EUR 5,000. The tax administration must ask the taxable person to fulfil his obligations prior to the imposition of the penalty.</p>
                  <p>Based on the guidance issued by the tax administration, the penalty fee for late filing of the EC Sales Lists is a maximum of EUR 200.</p>

                  <title>Rules before 1 January 2017</title>
                  <p>Before 2017, the following rules applied. The rules as discussed below are still applicable to issues related to the tax periods that ended in 2016 or earlier. </p>
                  <p>Fixed administrative fines may be imposed if the entrepreneur does not fulfil his VAT reporting obligations. Where an incorrect return or other incorrect information is submitted, a penalty may be imposed, generally up to 30% of the difference between the VAT assessed and the VAT paid on the basis of the incorrect information. However, for serious violations, the penalty may be 100% of the unpaid amount of VAT or EUR 15,000 (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s176">section 182 of the AVL</extxref>). The taxpayer must be given an opportunity to be heard.</p>
                  <p>There is a special penalty for late filing. The amount of the penalty is based on 20% annual interest in respect of the amount not reported on time. The maximum amount of the penalty is either the amount of VAT not reported on time, or EUR 15,000. The penalty may be assessed even though there is no VAT to be paid. The tax authorities may decide not to assess the penalty in particular circumstances, and upon the request of the taxable person.</p>
                  <p>Omissions or inaccurate filing of EC Sales Lists may give rise to a penalty between EUR 80 and EUR 1,700.</p>
                  <p>A penalty for failure to file the Intrastat return ranges between EUR 10 and 2,500 (section 32 of the Customs Law, <emph type="i">Tullilaki</emph>, <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_tl">TL</xref>). In practice, the EUR 100 penalty is generally applied to the initial failure to file the return; this amount is increased with EUR 100 per month in the case of further non-compliance.</p>

            <p>Non-resident entrepreneurs carrying on business from a fixed establishment in Finland are subject to VAT in the same manner as resident entrepreneurs. In the absence of a fixed establishment, the buyer of the goods or services supplied in Finland is, in general, responsible for VAT (unless he is also a non-resident and the non-resident seller has not voluntarily registered for VAT), regardless of whether the buyer carries on a business (reverse charge). The reverse charge mechanism does not apply to passenger transport, educational, entertainment or scientific services in Finland, and it may not be used if the customer is a private individual.</p>

               <p>Non-resident entrepreneurs, i.e. entrepreneurs who do not reside in Finland and who have a fixed establishment in Finland, are subject to VAT, liable for registration and entitled to a deduction for input tax according to the same principles that apply to resident entrepreneurs.</p>
               <p>The Finnish VAT legislation does not provide a definition of “fixed establishment”. Taxpayers must take into account the definition included in Regulation laying down implementing measures for Directive <extxref publish="n" target="vatdir_2006_112_eng">2006/112/EC</extxref> on the common system of value added tax (282/2011), which is legally binding. A fixed establishment is any establishment characterized by a sufficient degree of permanence and a suitable structure in terms of human and technical resources to enable it to receive and use the services supplied to it for its own needs (article 11 of the Regulation). The leasing of movable or immovable property or intangible rights does not, as such, constitute a fixed establishment.</p>
               <p>If a non-resident entrepreneur is engaged in the commercial supply of taxable goods or services in Finland, but does not have a fixed establishment in Finland (and has not applied voluntarily for a taxable status), the buyer – and not the non-resident seller – is liable for VAT (reverse charge; <extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s9">section 9 of the AV</extxref>L). If the Finnish state is the buyer, neither the seller nor the buyer is, however, liable for VAT, and no VAT is due.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the buyer is not liable for VAT if (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s9">sections 9</extxref> and <extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s67">67.1 of the AVL</extxref>):</p>

               </list>
               <p>In these cases, the VAT liability is not reversed. The non-resident supplier is liable for VAT and must register even though he does not have a fixed establishment in Finland (<extxref publish="n" target="vatleg_fi_01_eng__td1_s9">section 9 of the AVL</extxref>).</p>
               <p>A non-resident entrepreneur engaged in intra-Community acquisitions in Finland must register as a non-resident entrepreneur for reporting purposes which is a simplified VAT registration. Because the liability to file VAT returns on these acquisitions does not mean VAT liability, reverse charge applies. If the non-resident entrepreneur also makes zero-rated supplies in Finland, he should register for VAT purposes in Finland.</p>
               <p>A non-resident entrepreneur who carries out taxable activities in Finland, but does not have a fixed establishment in Finland or obligation to register, may voluntarily register for VAT purposes. Taxable persons established in an EU Member State are not required to appoint a tax representative, following the law change based on the judgement of the European Court of Justice of 15 June 2006 in the case <emph type="i">Commission v. Finland</emph> (<extxref publish="n" target="ecj_c_249_05">C-249/05</extxref>). Other taxable persons are required to appoint a resident tax representative approved by the tax office. The representative is responsible for maintaining appropriate accounts for the business in Finland, but is not liable for the tax itself.</p>
               <p>Landlords who rent out premises to entrepreneurs may opt for VAT registration on their leasing activities, provided that the tenants use the premises for their taxable business purposes which entitle to VAT recovery. If the landlord is not registered for renting out immovable property or other premises, he may not charge VAT on the rents and may not recover input VAT.</p>
               <p>With effect from 1 July 2021, the OSS scheme applies to registering, reporting and paying the VAT for the distance sales of goods imported from third countries in consignments of an intrinsic value not exceeding EUR 150. The OSS scheme does not apply to goods that are subject to excise tax. Use of the OSS scheme is optional.</p>

               <p>The transfer of shares in Finnish companies, other than in housing and real estate companies, and other domestic securities is subject to a transfer tax of 1.6% of the sales price, but only if the transfer is not made through the stock exchange (sections 15, 15a and 20 of the <xref target="cta_fi_2022-07-28_abb_vsvl">VSVL</xref>). The transfer of shares in Finnish housing or real estate companies, as defined, or in companies the activity of which in practice is directly or indirectly owning or controlling real property (e.g. a holding company), is subject to transfer tax of 2% of the sales price (if the transfer is made on or after 1 March 2013). Even though the parties may have agreed which party pays the tax to the tax office, the tax may be collected from the purchaser. Only if the purchaser is non-resident in Finland, is the seller responsible for collecting the transfer tax from the purchaser and for paying it to the tax office.</p>
               <p>No transfer tax is due if shares of a foreign company are sold or if both the seller and the purchaser are non-residents. However, this exemption does not apply if one of the parties to the transfer is a Finnish branch of a foreign bank or a foreign investment company (section 16 of the VSVL). Transfer tax is always payable on transfers between non-residents if the transferred shares are shares in a Finnish housing or real estate company, as defined, or in companies the activity of which in practice is directly or indirectly owning or controlling real property (e.g. a holding company).</p>

            <title>Customs duty</title>
            <p>Customs law includes legal and administrative provisions that govern cross-border movement of goods. In the European Union, customs law is harmonized and applies only to movements of goods between the European Union and third countries. Customs duties, as well as other indirect taxes (e.g. VAT), are imposed on the import of goods into the EU Customs Union. </p>
            <p>The EU Customs Union consists of the EU Member States, as well as the areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (in Cyprus) and Monaco (in France). Until 31 December 2020, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom were also part of the EU Customs Union. After that date, due to the United Kingdom’s full departure from the European Union, the movement of goods between these jurisdictions and the European Union is governed by customs procedures and formalities. In general, EU customs rules and facilitations continue to apply to goods entering and leaving Northern Ireland. </p>
            <p>Andorra, San Marino and Turkey have separate customs agreements with the European Union.</p>
            <p>The basis for calculating the customs duty is the customs value, which is generally the sum of the price paid for the goods and any related insurance and shipping costs. A percentage (tariff), which depends on the type and origin of the good being imported, is then applied to the customs value to determine the customs duty payable. The applicable tariff can be found in the integrated customs tariff database of the European Union (TARIC), which has its legal basis in the <extxref publish="n" target="evd_2003_-_annex_1_cn_to_reg._2658-87">Regulation on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (87/2658)</extxref>.

            <p>A trader importing goods into the European Union must register with the EU customs authorities and obtain an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number. A trader established in the European Union must register in the EU Member State of establishment. Third-country traders are required to request an EORI number in the EU Member State where they intend to first file an entry summary declaration. The EORI number is valid for customs purposes throughout the European Union and must be used in the communication with the customs authorities. A single EORI number across the European Union is efficient for economic operators and customs authorities, but also for statistical and security purposes.</p>
            <p>Importation of goods from outside the European Union constitutes a taxable transaction for customs duty purposes. The establishment of customs duties takes into account three factors: (i) the customs value of the goods; (ii) the applicable customs tariff; and (iii) the origin of the goods. Customs duties are calculated by applying the customs tariff to the customs value. The customs value of imported goods is based on the transaction value method, which is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the EU customs territory. The transaction value must be increased by certain expenses (e.g. cost of transport, insurance of the imported goods, loading and handling charges associated with the transport of the imported goods to the place of introduction into the EU customs territory and, under certain conditions, royalties and licence fees), and is reduced by certain deductions. If the transaction value cannot be determined, alternative methods must be applied in order to establish the customs value, namely (in order): the value of identical goods, the value of similar goods, the deductive value, the computed value and the fall-back value method. Each of these methods may be used, but only where the previous method is inadequate for purposes of determining the customs value (i.e. the deductive value method may only be used if the value of similar goods method is not adequate).</p>
            <p>The person liable for import duties is the person who files the customs declaration or on whose behalf the declaration is filed by a representative. The declarant (or representative) must be established in the EU customs territory. Customs law permits both direct and indirect representation. Where several persons are liable for one customs debt, they are jointly and severally liable for that amount.</p>
            <p>There are two main payment schemes for customs duties: immediate payment and deferred payment. In general, import duties must be paid within the period prescribed by the customs authorities, which may not exceed 10 days following notification to the debtor of the customs debt. The obligation to pay import duties may be deferred for a 30-day period upon request if certain conditions are met.</p>
            <p>The <extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2_89_eng_2013_tt">Union Customs Code (2013/952)</extxref> provides for three customs procedures: (i) release for free circulation, (ii) special procedures and (iii) export. Special procedures are simplification measures allowing traders to benefit from the suspension or lower rate of customs duties and include four categories: (i) transit (external and internal), (ii) storage (customs warehousing and free zones), (iii) processing (inward and outward processing) and (iv) specific use (end-use and temporary admission).</p>
            <p>Regarding transit, under the external transit procedure, non-EU goods may be moved from one point to another within the EU customs territory without being subject to import duties or commercial policy measures. Under the internal transit procedure, EU goods may be moved from one point to another within the EU customs territory and pass through a country or territory outside that customs territory, without any change in their customs status. </p>
            <p>As for the storage procedure, customs warehousing allows the storage of non-EU goods without subjecting them to import duties or other commercial policy measures. Goods may be stored in public and private warehouses. Public warehouses are available for use by any person, whereas private warehouses are reserved for use by persons authorized to operate the warehouse. </p>
            <p>Under the inward processing procedure, non-EU goods may be used in the EU customs territory in one or more processing operations without being subject to import duties or other commercial policy measures. The outward processing procedure allows EU goods to be temporarily exported from the EU customs territory in order to undergo processing operations. The processed products resulting from those goods may be released for free circulation with total or partial relief from customs duties. </p>
            <p>Lastly, under the temporary admission procedure, non-EU goods intended for re-export may be subject to specific use in the EU customs territory, with total or partial relief from import duty. Under the end-use procedure, goods may be released for free circulation under a duty exemption or at a reduced rate of duty on account of their specific use.</p>
            <p>Companies having the status of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO), as provided under the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_e2_89_eng_2013_tt">Union Customs Code (2013/952)</extxref>, are able to take advantage of customs simplifications and/or benefit from facilitations relating to security and safety. They are also given a more favourable treatment in respect of customs controls, such as fewer physical and document-based controls.</p>

               <p>Passenger cars, vans and motorcycles are subject to a car tax (<emph type="i">autovero</emph>) when they are registered or brought into use for the first time. The amount of car tax depends on the general retail sales price of the vehicle on the Finnish market and the carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
               <p>In addition, there is also a tax on vehicles that are in use in Finland (<emph type="i">ajoneuvovero</emph>). The tax on the vehicles in use consists of (i) a basic tax; and (ii) tax on driving power (<emph type="i">käyttövoimavero</emph>). The amount of the basic tax depends on the weight of the vehicle and on the carbon dioxide emissions. Tax on driving power applies to vehicles other than those powered by gas (e.g. it applies to those vehicles powered by diesel, electricity, etc.). The amount of the tax on driving power varies depending on the type of power used (diesel, electricity, bioethanol or a combination thereof), the number of days the vehicle is used, the type of vehicle (personal car, caravan, van, lorry, etc.) and the weight of the vehicle.</p>
