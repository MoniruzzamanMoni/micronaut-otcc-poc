            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Corporate taxpayers are subject to two taxes on income and capital, namely the corporate income tax (<emph type="i">imposto de renda das pessoas jurídicas</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_irpj">IRPJ</xref>) (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.10.1.">1.10.1.</xref>) and the social contribution on net profits (<emph type="i">Contribuição Social Sobre o Lucro Líquido</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_csll">CSLL</xref>) (section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.1.">2.3.1.</xref>), both hereinafter referred to as corporate income taxes <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref>.</p>
            <p>Although the CSLL is, from a formal perspective, a social contribution, its taxable base and the general principles of its imposition are almost the same as of the IRPJ. In this sense, all income subject to IRPJ is, in general, also subject to the CSLL. For this reason, in practice, the CSLL should be viewed as a type of corporate income tax. Therefore, this chapter jointly discusses, in general, both the IRPJ and the CSLL (referred to as CIT). Nevertheless, some minor specifications of the CSLL are dealt with in section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.1.">2.3.1.</xref> </p>
            <p>In the text, whenever the intention is to solely refer to the corporate income tax, the abbreviation IRPJ is adopted, while the social contribution on net profits is referred to as CSLL.</p>
            <p>In addition to the CIT, Brazilian tax laws also impose two social contributions on gross revenue, namely the contribution to the Social Integration Programme (<emph type="i">Programa de Integração Social</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pis">PIS</xref>) and the contribution for the financing of social security (<emph type="i">Contribuição para o Financiamento da Seguridade Social</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cofins">COFINS</xref>). Although formally introduced as social contributions, the PIS and COFINS should be considered as actual taxes on income, as they are imposed, in general, on all revenues of the corporate taxpayer. <emph type="i">See</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.2.">2.3.2.</xref> for details on the PIS and section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.3.">2.3.3.</xref> for COFINS. However, different from the CSLL, such contributions are levied on gross revenue and not on net income and, for this reason, are not considered here as part of the CIT.</p>
            <p>On 3 April 2019, the Bill for Amendment of the Constitution 45/2019 (Bill 45/2019) was presented to the Chamber of Deputies of the National Congress. Bill 45/2019 proposes a tax reform to simplify the Brazilian tax system through the unification of taxes and contributions charged on consumption. Under the proposal, the federal tax on manufactured products (<emph type="i">imposto sobre produtos industrializados</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref>), PIS, COFINS, the interstate and intermunicipal transportation, and on communication services (<emph type="i">imposto sobre circulação de mercadorias e serviços de transporte interestadual e intermunicipal e de comunicação</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_icms">ICMS</xref>) and the municipal tax on services (<emph type="i">Imposto sobre Serviços de Qualquer Natureza</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_iss">ISS</xref>) are replaced by the “single tax on goods and services” (<emph type="i">Imposto Único sobre Bens e Serviços</emph>, IBS) throughout a transitory period of 10 years (a trial period of 2 years in which the COFINS rate will be reduced and IBS charged at 1%; and an implementation period of 8 years in which the IPI, ICMS, ISS, PIS and COFINS rates will be progressively reduced). Bill 45/2019 is still under analysis by the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
            <p>In parallel to Bill 45/2019, on 9 July 2019, a second bill (Bill for Amendment of the Constitution 110/2019 (Bill 110/2019)) was presented to the Senate. Bill 110/2019 also proposes a tax reform to simplify the tax system through the unification of taxes and contributions charged on consumption. Under this proposal, IPI, PIS, COFINS, ICMS, ISS, the federal tax on financial transactions (<emph type="i">imposto sobre operações financeiras</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_iof">IOF</xref>), the contribution to Intervention on the Economic Domain levied on fuel (<emph type="i">contribuição de Intervenção no Domínio Econômico</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cide">CIDE</xref>-Combustível) and the education contribution (<emph type="i">salário educação</emph>) are replaced by the state "tax on transactions with goods and services" (<emph type="i">imposto sobre operações com bens e serviços</emph>, IBS) and by a federal tax on specific goods and services named "selective tax" (<emph type="i">imposto seletivo</emph>) throughout a transitory period of 15 years. </p>
            <p>In addition, Bill 110/2019 proposes (i) that the inheritance and gift tax – currently a state tax – becomes a federal tax collected by the federal government and (ii) to extend the taxable events for tax on automotive vehicles ownership (<emph type="i">imposto sobre a propriedade de veículos automotores</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipva">IPVA</xref>) to cover the ownership of airplanes and vessels (with the exception of those used for commercial fishing, public transport and cargo purposes). Bill 110/2019 is still under analysis by the Senate.</p>
            <p>On 21 July 2020, the Minister of Economy presented to the National Congress another proposal for tax reform (Bill 3887/2020), which aims at unifying the PIS and COFINS into one contribution on goods and services (<emph type="i">Contribuição sobre Bens e Serviços</emph>, CBS). According to the proposal, CBS would be levied at a flat tax rate of 12% (5.8% for financial institutions) on gross revenue from imports and local sales of services and goods. ICMS and ISS paid would be deductible from the CBS taxable base. Digital platforms would be responsible for collecting the CBS due in transactions in which they act as intermediaries and the seller does not issue an invoice according to state and municipal legislation. Non-resident suppliers would be required to register in Brazil and collect the CBS due in cases where the importer is an individual. Nonetheless, the bill does not provide for a penalty for non-residents failing to comply with the obligation to register in Brazil. The proposal is being developed in the framework of an agreement between the Ministry of Economy, the President of the Senate and the President of the Chamber of Deputies to create a mixed commission in charge of preparing a text for a tax reform.</p>
            <p>On 25 June 2021, another bill was submitted by the government (Bill 2337/2021) with proposals to, among others, change corporate income tax rates and individual income tax brackets, to extinguish interest on net equity type of payment (and consequently its deduction for tax purposes), and to introduce the taxation of dividends. On 2 September 2021, Bill 2337/2021 was approved (with amendments) by the Chamber of Deputies; it still needs to be voted on and approved by the Senate.</p>
            <p>As a result, Bill 45/2019, Bill 110/2019, Bill 3887/2020 and Bill 2337/2021 are currently under consideration by the National Congress.</p>
            <p>In addition, specific proposals to tax digital services provided by non-resident companies are also being discussed by the National Congress – <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.5.">14.6.4.5.</xref>
            </p>
            <p>On 1 July 2021 and 8 October 2021, Brazil signed joint statements with other Inclusive Framework members with an agreement to implement a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy (<emph type="i">see</emph> details in <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_7.3.1.">sections 7.3.1.</xref>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.6.">10.6.</xref> and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.5.">14.6.4.5.</xref>).</p>

               <p>Brazilian taxing rights cover its complete territory, which includes 27 federal units. The 27 federal units are grouped in five large geographic regions: the northern region (comprising the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Pará, Roraima, Rondônia and Tocantins); the north-east region (comprising the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Ceará, Maranhão, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe); the central-west region (comprising the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and the Federal District); the south-east region (comprising the states of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo) and the southern region (comprising the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina).</p>
               <p>In territorial waters, Brazilian jurisdiction includes territories varying from 40 to 160 nautical miles from the main shore, several islands and the archipelagos of Marajó and Fernando de Noronha.</p>

               <title>Statutory framework</title>
               <p>Brazil adopts a constitutional tax system, under which the main provisions governing the taxing rights of the Federal, State and Municipal governments are included in sections 145 to 162 of the Federal Constitution.</p>
               <p>As a consequence of the constitutional tax system, most tax claims have constitutional grounds and may be contested at the Federal Supreme Court (<emph type="i">Supremo Tribunal Federal</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_stf">STF</xref>). Tax litigation in Brazil is rather common and can last several years.</p>
               <p>The National Tax Code (<emph type="i">Código Tributário Nacional</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ctn">CTN</xref>) contains further rules on taxation, tax administration, taxpayers, tax obligations, tax responsibility and specific rules on import and export duties, municipal tax on real estate, income tax, federal excise tax, value added taxes, tax on financial transactions, municipal service tax, municipal tax on real estate transfer, special and extraordinary taxes and general levies. Notwithstanding the provisions of the CTN, specific laws are enacted, with the detailed rules of each tax introduced by the competent taxing authority (federal, state or municipal).</p>
               <p>Legal hierarchy applies to the Brazilian legal tax system. Therefore, the legislation concerning the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> is primarily contained in the Federal Constitution and the CTN. In addition, CIT legislation comprises complementary laws, international treaties and conventions, ordinary laws, decrees and other regulations (i.e. normative instructions, administrative rulings, etc.). In any case, under the provisions of the Federal Constitution on the Brazilian tax system, taxes may only be imposed and/or increased only via law (the legality principle), i.e. the administrative rules may not increase or impose taxes but simply regulate the provisions of the law. The Federal Constitution, however, provides for some exceptions to this principle, mainly in connection with taxes that have a hybrid nature (which are used not only for financing the public services, but also for intervening in a specific sector of the economy).</p>
               <p>Federal laws are enacted by the Congress. They are identified by a number and the date of issuance. Laws, provisional measures (<xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pm">PM</xref>), decrees and certain other official acts are published in the Federal Official Gazette (<emph type="i">Diário Oficial da União</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_dou">DOU</xref>).</p>
               <p>The President of Brazil may propose tax-related bills of law. Once a federal law is approved by the federal Congress, it is returned to the President for his approval or veto. Laws enter into force 45 days after their publication in the Federal Official Gazette unless otherwise provided therein. However, legal provisions referring to taxes on income and capital are only effective after 90 days from the publication of the relevant law and/or in some cases from the first day of the assessment period following its publication, in situations where such legal provisions:</p>

In spite of its urgent nature, PM are commonly used by the executive to introduce new legislation that could, otherwise, follow the ordinary course in the legislative power.</p>
               <p>There are several laws dealing with CIT, some of which were even enacted prior to the 1988 Federal Constitution and have since been updated. The scattered provisions are codified from time to time into a consolidated text, via a decree enacted by the executive branch, known as the Income Tax Regulations (<emph type="i">Regulamento do Imposto de Renda</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_rir">RIR</xref>).

A consortium must therefore be registered as a taxpayer before federal tax authorities, although it is not actually subject to CIT on its individual capacity. Instead, companies participating in the consortium are liable for all taxes due as a result of the activities carried out in proportion to their participation in the consortium (as regulated by Normative Instruction 1,199/2011).

               <title>Definition of residence</title>
               <p>Brazilian law refers to the concept of “domicile” rather than “residence”. As Brazilian tax law does not specify the criteria to determine when a legal person is considered to be domiciled in Brazil, the general concept of corporate domicile found in the Brazilian Civil Code is used for tax purposes. Under that code, the domicile of a legal person is the place where its headquarters or main direction is located, or the special domicile indicated in the act of incorporation. The criteria used is the place of incorporation, as the residence of a legal person is considered to be the place where it has its headquarters or place of main direction, as indicated in the act of constitution of the legal person when registered in Brazil. It does not provide, therefore, for the material analysis of the place where, in practice, the management takes place, but the formal indication in the act of incorporation of the place where it is headquartered or directed.</p>
               <p>For legal persons the head office or place of main direction of which is outside Brazil, the Civil Code states that the place of residence is deemed to be, for the purpose of the obligations of the permanent establishment in Brazil, the place where such permanent establishment is situated. For international purposes, this is a peculiar provision, as it considers that a permanent establishment of a non-resident person is a resident of Brazil. A normal conclusion would lead to the application of the principle of universality to the permanent establishment. However, the article indicates that the residence is deemed to be in Brazil only for the purpose of obligations of the permanent establishment. In this case, it may be concluded that the Civil Code applies a restriction on the principle of universality, as regards the permanent establishment. This principle would therefore not be applicable to permanent establishments in Brazil, although they are deemed to be resident in Brazil under the civil law.</p>
               <p>In defining the term “residence”, Brazilian treaties generally follow the OECD Model, but normally exclude the following sentence of article 4, paragraph 1 of the OECD Model: “This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein”.</p>
               <p>Although Brazilian law refers to the concept of domicile, for the purpose of consistency, this chapter refers to domiciled and non-domiciled persons as resident and non-resident persons.</p>

               <p>The <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ctn">CTN</xref> defines taxable income as:</p>
               <list>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>proceeds resulting from capital, labour or their combination; and</p>
                  </item>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>income of any kind, i.e. any increase in wealth.</p>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Hence, as income is broadly defined, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> applies to all revenues received as the product of capital or services, or a combination thereof, as well as any and all gains resulting from the disposal of the taxpayer’s assets or rights. CIT is, therefore, imposed on income derived from industrial and commercial transactions, as well as the rendering of services. Financial revenue, income from portfolio investments and gains from the disposal of other assets or rights are also included in taxable income, whatever their source.</p>
               <p>Resident companies are taxed on worldwide income. Under the rules introduced by Law 9,249/1995 and article 74 of <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pm">PM</xref> 2,158-35/2001, a Brazilian-resident company not only must include the foreign-source income derived (whether directly or through a permanent establishment) but also the profits earned by its foreign controlled or affiliated companies in the proportion of the equity stake held in such entities (on 31 December of every year), regardless of effective distribution. It can be said that Brazil has introduced an extraterritorial system of taxation (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_7.2.">7.2.</xref>).</p>
               <p>There are basically four different regimes for purposes of assessing and collecting CIT, namely: (i) the actual profit regime (<emph type="i">lucro real</emph>); (ii) the presumed profit regime (<emph type="i">lucro presumido</emph>); (iii) the simplified regime for the collection of federal taxes and contributions (<emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph>); and (iv) the determined profit regime (<emph type="i">lucro arbitrado</emph>). Other specific regimes are also available for some types of activities (such as the Special Tax Regime for Real Estate Development).</p>
               <p>The two most relevant regimes are the actual profit regime and the presumed profit regime. The presumed profit regime is an optional regime available for some legal entities and may be more efficient from a tax collection perspective, depending on the profitability level of the business.</p>

                  <title>Actual profit regime</title>
                  <p>Under the actual profit regime, taxable persons for CIT purposes are taxed on their actual profit, which is legally defined as the adjusted accounting profit, i.e. the accounting profit with the additions and exclusions provided for in the tax law.</p>
                  <p>As a general principle under the Federal Constitution, all sorts of income should be considered for CIT purposes. Therefore, unless otherwise provided for in the tax laws, any equity increase is considered taxable income.</p>
                  <p>Some legal entities are obliged to adopt the actual profit regime. These entities are:</p>

                  <p>As a general rule, corporate taxpayers must adopt the accrual regime for the recognition of revenues and expenses, regardless of the effective receipt of the relevant payment. In some specific cases, however, the law expressly allows that the cash regime is adopted (such as with regard to real estate developments in which the sale of units is agreed for payment in instalments).</p>
                  <p>Corporate taxpayers may opt to assess the CIT annually or quarterly. If the quarterly assessment is elected, the taxable period is deemed to actually end on the last day of each quarter (and all revenues within such quarter must be considered for the assessment of CIT). If the annual assessment is elected, the taxable period ends on 31 December.</p>
                  <p>Capital gains realized by legal entities are normally added to the taxable base and taxed as ordinary income for CIT purposes (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.7.1.">1.7.1.</xref>).</p>

Revaluation of assets was possible under the accounting rules that applied before the introduction of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

                  <p>As from 2010, this method for computing taxable income was affected by some changes, considering the provisions of articles 15 to 24 of Law 11,941/2009, which intended to neutralize the impacts of the new accounting methods and criteria set forth by Law 11,638/2007.</p>
                  <p>Law 11,638/2007 introduced the IFRS in the Brazilian accounting system, therefore changing some criteria usually adopted for the recognition of income, expenses and costs, and for the accounting computation of some specific transactions. Although the changes introduced by Law 11,638/2007 certainly produce effects for accounting purposes, the Brazilian government decided that such changes would not be considered for tax purposes (i.e. for tax purposes, a Brazilian-resident company would still rely on the Brazilian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as to the recognition of revenues, expenses, etc.), establishing therefore the “tax neutrality” of the IFRS. In principle, the tax neutrality would be temporary, in order to allow Brazilian companies to gradually adapt to the IFRS. In view of the tax neutrality principle, Law 11,941/2009 introduced the “transitional tax regime” (<emph type="i">Regime Tributário de Transição</emph>, RTT) as an option for the years 2008 and 2009. As of the year of 2010, the RTT became mandatory for all Brazilian entities, until a law governing the tax effects of the new accounting rules was enacted.</p>
                  <p>The RTT allowed the effects of Law 11,638/2007 on the criteria for the determination of revenues, costs and expenses not to impact the calculation of the legal entity’s actual profit. Therefore, in practice, the Brazilian entities maintained two different balance sheets, i.e. an “accounting balance sheet” (prepared under IFRS) and a “tax balance sheet” (prepared under the previously existing Brazilian GAAP, based on the RTT).</p>
                  <p>Recently, Law 12,937/2014, which is generally effective as of 1 January 2015, revoked the RTT and introduced several tax accounting rules. These changes are generally designed to ensure that the legal and contractual nature of the transactions prevails for tax purposes, irrespective of the accounting treatment. The main points addressed by the new law include: (i) the adoption of the new rules (early adoption before 2015 was possible); (ii) tax treatment of dividends, interest on net equity and the equity pick-up (<emph type="i">método de equivalência patrimonial</emph>); and (iii) tax amortization of goodwill.</p>

                  <title>Presumed profit regime</title>
                  <p>Eligible legal entities may opt to be taxed under the presumed profit regime. Under article 13 of Law 9,718/1998, as modified by Law 12,814/2013, legal entities whose total gross income, including capital gains, did not exceed BRL 78 million (previously BRL 48 million) in the prior year (or BRL 6.5 million multiplied by the number of months of activity in the prior calendar year, previously BRL 4 million) and which are not obliged to adopt the actual profit regime may choose to be taxed under the presumed profit regime. According to Law 12,814/2013, the new gross revenue limit for opting for the presumed profit regime is effective as of 1 January 2014.</p>
                  <p>This option can be exercised on a yearly basis always before the date on which the first monthly CIT instalment must be paid.</p>
                  <p>The presumed profit regime is a simplified method for the calculation of CIT under which the legal entity assesses its taxable profit by applying a pre-determined percentage (as established in the law) to its total gross revenue earned in the quarter (in the presumed profit regime, the annual assessment is not an option). Therefore, the starting point for the assessment of CIT is the legal entity’s gross revenue, and no deductions are allowed.</p>
                  <p>The applicable percentages are different in connection with the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_irpj">IRPJ</xref> and the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_csll">CSLL</xref>. For the IRPJ, the applicable percentages for the definition of the taxable base range from 1.6% (for income related to the sale of fuel and natural gas) to 32% (for income from the rendering of services). Commercial activities are, in general, subject to the 8% presumed profit percentage. With regard to the CSLL, the presumed profit is obtained by applying the percentages of 12% or 32% (also depending on the activity of the company). The 12% percentage generally applies to commercial activities, while the 32% applies to the rendering of services. If the legal entity is engaged in different types of activities, the specific percentage should apply to the revenue earned in view of each activity.</p>
                  <p>Capital gains, revenue from financial investments and any other income must be directly added to the taxable profit subject to CIT (i.e. no presumed percentage applies).</p>
                  <p>The tax is assessed by applying the IRPJ (15%) and the CSLL (9%) rates to the taxable profit. The IRPJ surtax of 10% is also applied, but under this regime, it is applicable to the amount exceeding BRL 20,000, multiplied by the number of months to which it relates (e.g. BRL 60,000 for a quarter).</p>
                  <p>Taxes withheld on income included in the recipient’s taxable profit are credited.</p>
                  <p>Considering the presumed profit percentages and the CIT rates, it is common to say that the CIT, under the presumed profit regime, is imposed at a maximum aggregate rate of 10.88%, in connection with the rendering of services, and of 3.08% in connection with commercial activities.</p>

                  <title>Simplified regime for the collection of taxes and contributions (<emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph>)</title>
                  <p>Resolution CGSN 140/2018, published in the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_dou">DOU</xref> of 24 May 2018, consolidates the rules applicable under the <emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph> regime. Accordingly, micro enterprises, currently considered by law as those with an annual gross income of less than BRL 360,000, and small enterprises, whose annual gross income does not exceed BRL 4.8 million, may opt for a simplified regime for the joint collection of federal, state and municipal taxes and contributions. Individual entrepreneurs treated as corporate taxpayers (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.1.4.">1.1.4.</xref>), referred to as MEI by the Law, may also adopt the simplified regime, provided that their annual gross revenue does not exceed BRL 81,000.</p>
                  <p>Small and micro enterprises are entitled to an extra annual gross income limit of BRL 3.6 million for revenues arising from exported goods and services.</p>
                  <p>Some legal entities may not qualify for the <emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph> regime, even if the above revenue thresholds are respected. Among others, the following entities do not qualify: (i) an entity incorporated as a corporation (<emph type="i">sociedade anônima</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_sa">SA</xref>), (ii) an entity having a non-resident shareholder and (iii) an entity whose shares are held by other legal entities. As of 1 January 2015, Complementary Law 147/2014 extended the list of business activities eligible for the <emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph> regime to include any service activity duly regulated and of an intellectual, technical, scientific, sportive, artistic or cultural nature, provided that certain conditions are met. This means that professionals such as lawyers, doctors and engineers are able to opt for the simplified tax regime.</p>
                  <p>The regime consists of a single monthly payment covering IRPJ, CSLL, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref> (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_13.4.">13.4.</xref>), <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cofins">COFINS</xref> (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.2.">2.3.2.</xref>), <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pis">PIS</xref> (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.3.">2.3.3.</xref>), <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_icms">ICMS</xref> (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.1.">14.6.4.1.</xref>), <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_iss">ISS</xref> (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.2.">14.6.4.2.</xref>) and a contribution of the employer to the social security (c<emph type="i">ontribuição patronal previdenciária para a seguridade social</emph>) (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_4.1.">4.1.</xref>). Under the regime, the total liability for the taxes is calculated via application of a percentage to the legal entity’s gross revenue. The rates vary in accordance with the activity that generated the revenue (which leads to the imposition or not of some of the taxes) and it is progressive according to the level of revenue.</p>
                  <p>The Brazilian states may adopt reduced thresholds in relation to the possibility of the legal entity adopting the <emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph> regime for the collection of the ICMS. When said reduction is in place, the same threshold applies for the adoption of the <emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph> regime for the collection of the ISS due in relation to the municipalities within the borders of that state. In those cases, the <emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph> regime would still apply for the collection of federal taxes and contributions, but the regular collection regimes would apply for the ICMS and the ISS.</p>
                  <p>The monthly payment is calculated at progressive rates ranging from 4% to 22.90%, although it may be increased in some specific situations provided for in the applicable laws.</p>

                  <p>Income tax is payable at the rate of 15% on the determined profit. An additional income tax of 10% is levied on the determined profit in excess of BRL 20,000 accrued monthly (or BRL 240,000 in the calendar year). Also, a CSLL is imposed at the rate of 9%.</p>

               <p>The Federal Constitution establishes a constitutional exemption (immunity) for the wealth, income or services of political parties, foundations, labour unions, and educational and welfare entities, as long as they are not-for-profit and meet the requirements established in the legislation. Brazilian political subdivisions (states, federal district and municipalities) and religious temples are also constitutionally exempt from taxes, including <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref>. A constitutional exemption also applied to books (including e-books - Binding Precedent 57/2020), newspapers, periodicals and to the paper used for printing.</p>
               <p>Philanthropic, recreational, cultural and scientific not-for-profit organizations may also enjoy CIT exemption, as long as certain requirements are met.</p>
               <p>Few items of income are exempt from tax, including domestic-source dividends (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_6.1.3.">6.1.3.</xref>) – the taxation of dividends at source at the rate of 15% is, however, being considered under Bill 2337/2021. Equity pick-up gains are also tax-free.</p>
               <p>The Brazilian government grants several tax exemptions to Brazilian companies, conditioned on the performance of determined activities or the establishment of companies in a specific Brazilian region (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.9.">1.9.</xref>).</p>

            <p>Brazil is in the process of harmonizing its accounting system with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.2.1.">1.2.1.</xref>). Although, currently, the effects of such process for tax purposes are neutralized by the RTT, this is an aspect that may be affected in the future. Recently, Law 12,973/2014 revoked the RTT with effect from 1 January 2015 – early adoption was possible. As a result of the new law, tax accounting rules should be aligned with IFRS. The law provides mechanisms to ensure the changes are tax neutral, but also provides conditions for its application as well as various exceptions.</p>
            <p>For Brazilian income tax purposes, transactions should reflect their market value. However, under Brazilian tax law, there are several transactions that may be performed at book value (for example amounts transferred for increasing the capital of a Brazilian resident company and a capital reduction for the devolution of assets to shareholders).</p>

               <title>Inventory</title>
               <p>For tax purposes, merchandise and raw materials are valued at the lesser of their market value or acquisition cost. The acquisition cost of merchandise intended to be sold includes transportation and insurance costs up to the taxpayer’s establishment (i.e. the cost, insurance, freight value), as well as non-recoverable taxes paid upon the local acquisition and importation.</p>
               <p>Goods for eventual consumption, whose value is not above 5% of the total cost of the products sold in the preceding tax year, may be registered as costs.</p>
               <p>The cost of merchandise sold and the cost of consumed raw materials are calculated on the basis of permanent registration of inventory or on the basis of inventory as registered at the end of the period.</p>
               <p>Finished and semi-finished products are valued at their production cost.</p>
               <p>The production cost of goods and services includes:</p>

               <title>General principles</title>
               <p>Deductions are only allowed with regard to the assessment of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> based on the actual profit regime. As a general rule, costs and expenses paid or incurred during the tax period may be deducted, to the extent that they qualify as necessary for the production of taxable income or for the maintenance of the source of that income. The necessity of an expense is determined based on its relation to the activity of the company. In order to be deductible, expenses must be ordinary and normal for the transactions or activities of the enterprise.</p>
               <p>Special rules apply to certain categories of expenses, namely advertising expenses, amortization, bad debts, gifts and contributions, entertainment expenses, insurance premiums, interest payments, directors’ remuneration and research expenses. Deductibility depends on specific conditions being fulfilled and is often limited.</p>
               <p>Normative Instruction 1,556/2015 established that if taxpayers do not deduct depreciation allowances of a fixed asset in a given period, they are neither allowed to cumulatively deduct the depreciation expenses in a different period in which the asset was used, nor to recover the non-deducted amounts by using rates higher than the maximum rates allowed.</p>
               <p>The acquisition cost of fixed assets is not considered as a business expense, except for assets the single value of which is not above BRL 326.61 or assets with a maximum useful life of 1 year. However, depreciation of fixed assets, when allowed, generates deductible expenses.</p>
               <p>Payments made to persons located in low-tax jurisdictions or benefiting from privileged tax regimes are deductible only if certain conditions are met. For details, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.6.1.">10.6.1.</xref> </p>

               <title>General principles</title>
               <p>Resident companies assessing <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> under the actual profit regime may benefit from depreciation of assets, as well as amortization of certain rights and capitalized expenses for CIT purposes.</p>
               <p>As a rule, depreciation of tangible fixed assets used in the taxpayer’s business or income-generating activities must be calculated at an annual percentage, under the straight-line method. Rates are calculated based on the useful life of the asset and published by the tax authorities – currently under Normative Instruction 1,700/2017.</p>
               <p>Under Law 4,506/1964, deductions for depreciation are at the taxpayer’s discretion and according to some (non-binding) administrative tax rulings, depreciation may be postponed. In loss years, depreciation must be accounted for the company’s net operational losses.</p>
               <p>As a general rule, no deduction is allowed for depreciation in excess of generally accepted rates, unless previously approved by the tax authorities (the request must be supported by an appraisal from the National Technology Institute or another recognized institution).</p>
               <p>The depreciation starts at the time the asset is installed, is available for operation or is in a condition to produce, even in loss years. Legal entities are allowed to use a lower rate for depreciation or even to not compute depreciation during a certain period, but they are not allowed to claim those amounts in the following periods by using depreciation in excess of generally accepted rules.</p>
               <p>Depreciation of land, of assets which value normally increases within time (i.e. antiquities, pieces of art), or assets that are not used for the business activity is not allowed.</p>
               <p>If an asset becomes useless before the end of the depreciable life, the balance may be written off as an expense in the year in which the loss of value occurs.</p>
               <p>Depreciation of fixed assets prior to the operating phase must be capitalized as pre-operating expenses, which may be amortized over a minimum period of 5 years.</p>
               <p>Depreciation allowances are calculated yearly on the useful life of the new asset (article 320 of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_rir">RIR</xref>). In the case of second-hand assets, depreciation is calculated on the greater of (1) half the useful life of the asset when it was new or (2) the remaining useful life (article 322 of the RIR). There are specific rules governing the accelerated depreciation of equipment and machinery.</p>
               <p>In the absence of a specific rate for a given type of asset, a standard straight-line depreciation of 10% a year is allowed. In case of doubt as regards depreciation percentages, the taxpayer or the administration may request an expert judgement from the National Institute of Technology. The useful life established by that institute prevails unless amended by a higher authority or by a court ruling on the basis of a valid expert report.</p>
               <p>If an asset becomes useless before the end of the depreciation period, the balance may be written off as an expense for the year in which the loss of value occurs (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.5.8.">1.5.8.</xref>).</p>
               <p>For accelerated depreciation, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.9.2.">1.9.2.</xref> </p>
               <p>Pre-operating expenses may be amortized over a minimum period of 5 years. Intangible assets, limited contractual rights and concessions related to the business activity of the corporate taxpayer may also be amortized over the period during which the right is exercised.</p>

               <p>The right to claim depreciation belongs to the entity that holds the economic burden of the deterioration of the asset, according to the conditions of property, possession or use of this asset. Therefore, in the case of leasing contracts, the lessor will be entitled to depreciate.

               <p>However, the capital used for the acquisition of a trademark is normally not subjected to amortization, because, as the right over the trademark can be renewed every 10 years, its use is not therefore limited to a certain period of time.</p>

               <title>Goodwill</title>
               <p>The capital invested in the acquisition of goodwill, such as improvements to the facilities, may be amortized when the rights involved are exercised or used only within a specified period. The annual amortization rate is fixed considering the remaining life (years) of the rights and is applied on the original value of the capital invested or of the registered expenses.</p>
               <p>Law 12,973/2014 regulated the tax amortization of the premium paid in the acquisition of goodwill. The acquiring entity must account investment’s costs in a separate sub-account to clearly demonstrate the amounts relating to: (i) net equity of the acquired company; (ii) the fair value of the net assets; and (iii) the goodwill derived from future profitability – which is the remaining balance from items (i) and (ii).</p>
               <p>Furthermore, apart from the requirement of an appraisal report prepared by an independent party, the goodwill is only deductible for tax purposes if the acquisition transaction is carried out by unrelated parties. This requirement was introduced by Law 12,973/2014 (prior to this Law, the amortization of internal goodwill was allowed).</p>

               <p>The costs for the acquisition of assets exclusively used for exploring mines, <emph type="i">jazidas</emph> – natural accumulation of a particular type of rock – and forests may be subject to depreciation, when the period of the exploration activity is shorter than the assets’ life time. The rates vary in accordance with (1) the term of the mining or forest concession; (2) the term of the exploration agreement; or (3) the production volume for each year vis-à-vis the total volume of the mine/forest.</p>
               <p>A premium paid within the acquisition of an investment (i.e. a positive difference between the equity value of the acquired investment and the respective acquisition price) may be amortized by the corporate taxpayer, provided that certain conditions are met. Generally speaking, the conditions are that the premium paid is justifiable based on the future profitability of the invested company and evidenced as such by an appraisal report, and that there is a merger between the investor and the invested company. The tax amortization of the premium must take place over a minimum 5-year term. In this regard, structures where premium amortization has been applied and that have been regarded as abusive by the tax authorities, have been questioned several times over the last years. Therefore, the benefit of premium amortization is currently a very controversial matter in Brazil.</p>

               <p>Upon the disposal of an asset, its acquisition cost for purposes of calculating taxable capital gains is the original acquisition cost reduced by the depreciation accumulated over the years. There are no recapturing or balancing allowances under Brazilian law.</p>

                  <p>The disposal of shares of closed-end legal entities not listed in the stock exchange market or in any organized over-the-counter market is subject to the assessment of capital gains based on the general regime.</p>
                  <p>Transactions regarding acquisition and disposal of shares of listed companies and other securities performed in the stock exchange market or in organized over-the-counter markets qualify as variable income investments in the financial and capital markets. Upon disposal of these assets the net gains (<emph type="i">ganhos líquidos)</emph> derived within the transaction must be assessed.</p>
                  <p>Net gains (<emph type="i">ganhos líquidos</emph>) follow the same principle of capital gains, i.e. they are assessed based on the positive difference between the acquisition cost and the disposal price. However, the net gains are not calculated in connection with each transaction, but rather it must consider all transactions involving the disposal of variable income investments performed during the month.</p>
                  <p>Gains from the disposal of securities within the stock exchange market or in an organized over-the-counter market (<emph type="i">mercado de balcão organizado</emph>) are subject to withholding income tax at the rate of 0.005% on the sales price (article 2, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Law 11,033/2004 and article 52 of Normative Instruction 1,022/2010). Such withholding tax may be credited against the final CIT liability.</p>
                  <p>In connection with day trade transactions, the withholding tax is imposed at a 1% rate (article 8 of Law 9,959/2000 and article 54 of Normative Instruction SRF 1,022/2010).</p>
                  <p>For the purposes of assessment of the monthly net gains, losses incurred in variable income transactions may be set off against gains derived in future variable income transactions of the same kind, in the same month or in subsequent months if the losses were not fully deducted in the month in which they were incurred. Losses incurred in connection with day trade transactions may not be deducted by corporate taxpayers under the actual profit regime.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, all expenses effectively incurred and outlined in trading invoices (such as brokerage fees and other related expenses) that were necessary for the acquisition and disposal of the securities may be deducted for purposes of assessing the net gains (article 27 of Law 8,383/1991, article 841, paragraph 2 of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_rir">RIR</xref> and section 45, paragraph 3 of Normative Instruction 1,022/2010).</p>
                  <p>Gains from the redemption of units of specific funds are subject to the following withholding tax rates:</p>

                  <p>The capitalization of securities is deemed to be a sale according to Declaratory Act 7/2007, so that taxpayers who capitalize investment funds with their own securities are deemed to derive capital gain (subject to income tax at the rate of 15%) on the difference between the market value and the acquisition cost of the security. For this purpose, investors must demonstrate the acquisition cost of the securities; otherwise, the acquisition cost is deemed to be zero. According to Provisional Measure 651/2014, converted into Law 13,043/2014, with effect from 1 January 2015, the administrator of the investment fund is responsible for the calculation and collection of income tax levied on capital gains realized by investors who use their own securities to capitalize the investment fund.</p>
                  <p>The actual payment of the CIT imposed on the net gains depends on the CIT regime adopted by the taxpayer and the mechanisms adopted for the collection. In general, under the actual profit regime, the net gains are collected separately and are not included in the monthly estimates. The gains are added to the taxable base of the CIT to determine the final CIT liability. If the taxpayer in a given month does not collect the CIT on the estimated base, in view of the assessment via a suspension or reduction balance sheet (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.11.4.">1.11.4.</xref>) the net gains are included in such balance sheet and do not need to be collected separately. Under the presumed profit regime, the net gains must be taxed separately.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the positive results obtained in transactions not performed in the stock exchange market or in the organized over-the-counter market (such as in non-organized over-the-counter markets) are treated as regular capital gains.</p>

                  <p>The main rules governing the treatment of losses are currently contained in article 42 of Law 8,981/1995, article 15 of Law 9,065/1995 and articles 25(5) and 31 of Law 9,249/1995.</p>

Accumulated losses may be carried forward indefinitely. There is no carry-back of losses.</p>
                  <p>The limitation of accumulated losses to 30% of taxable profit has been challenged in court by taxpayers as unconstitutional. Although there have been some preliminary decisions of lower courts preventing tax authorities from collecting taxes from taxpayers who have set off the full amount of accumulated losses (i.e. without taking into consideration the 30% limit), on 27 June 2019, the Federal Supreme Court confirmed that the limitation is constitutional (Extraordinary Appeal 591,340).</p>
                  <p>Accumulated tax losses may no longer be enjoyed by the taxpayer if there is a change in the control of the company cumulatively with a change in its activities.</p>

            <title>Incentives</title>
            <p>Brazil has made extensive use of incentives to promote the development of specific regions and activities. The incentive scheme covers export promotion, sectorial incentives and regional incentives. Regional incentives have proven to be the most elaborate and successful group.</p>
            <p>On 30 August 2017, the World Trade Organization (WTO) issued panel reports on Brazil’s measures concerning automotive and information technology programmes (Dispute Settlements 472 and 479). The reports concluded that the Programme for the Development of the Semiconductor Industry (<emph type="i">Programa de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento da Indústria de Semicondutores</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_padis">PADIS</xref>) (<emph type="i">see </emph>section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.9.4.8.">1.9.4.8.</xref>), the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_it">IT</xref> Law incentive (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.9.4.7.">1.9.4.7.</xref>), the Digital Inclusion Programme (no longer available), the Incentive Programme of Technological Innovation of the Production Line of Automotive Vehicles (<emph type="i">Programa de Incentivo à Inovação Tecnológica e Adensamento da Cadeia Produtiva de Veículos Automotores</emph>, INOVAR-AUTO) (no longer available) and the R&amp;D incentive for Digital TV Industry (<emph type="i">Programa de apoio ao desenvolvimento tecnológico da indústria de equipamentos para a TV digital</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_patvd">PATVD</xref>) (no longer available) are inconsistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) and the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs Agreement).</p>
            <p>Additionally, the panel concluded that the tax suspensions granted under the incentive for acquisition of inputs, intermediary products and packaging by export companies (<emph type="i">Programa Preponderantemente Exportador</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pec">PEC</xref>) and the incentive for acquisitions of capital goods by export companies (<emph type="i">Regime especial de aquisição de bens de capital para empresas exportadoras</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_recap">RECAP</xref>) (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.9.4.7.">1.9.4.7.</xref>) programmes qualify as prohibited subsidies within the scope of the SCM Agreement.</p>
            <p>To the extent that aspects of the challenged programmes are inconsistent with WTO rules, the panel recommends that Brazil brings the challenged measures into conformity with its obligations under the covered agreements and that it withdraws the subsidies identified without delay. Brazil has filed a notice of appeal in both dispute settlements. On 13 December 2018, the WTO appeals body issued its report in which it accepted Brazil’s argument in both cases in respect of the PEC and the RECAP and therefore reversed the panel’s decision on these incentives.</p>

               <title>Accelerated depreciation</title>
               <p>Under article 324 of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_rir">RIR</xref>, accelerated rates of depreciation may be established for new fixed assets used in modernization or expansion of certain industries. </p>
               <p>Article 323 of the RIR provides for accelerated depreciation for assets in accordance with the amount of hours used per day in the production process. The coefficients are: (i) 1 for 8 hours of operation; (ii) 1.5 for 16 hours of operation; and (iii) 2 for 24 hours of operation. As an example, one industrial machine with a normal depreciation rate of 10% is depreciated at 15% if it operates 16 hours a day, or at a 20% rate if it operates 24 hours a day.</p>
               <p>Law 11,196/2005 provides for accelerated depreciation for acquisitions of assets used for technological research and innovation (R&amp;D) and also for acquisitions made between 2006 and 2018 of assets by companies that were granted the incentives of the Superintendency for the Development of the Northeast (<emph type="i">Superintendência do Desenvolvimento do Nordeste</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_sudene">SUDENE</xref>) and the Superintendency for the Development of the Amazon (<emph type="i">Superintendência do Desenvolvimento da Amazônia</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_sudam">SUDAM</xref>) (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.9.4.5.">1.9.4.5.</xref>). Those assets may be integrally depreciated in the year of acquisition.</p>
               <p>Accelerated depreciation was also provided for by Law 11,774/2008 for assets acquired between 2008 and 2010 which are used by companies producing fixed assets. The depreciation rate is four times the normal depreciation rate. This same accelerated depreciation was granted to companies acquiring assets for the production of vehicles and their parts.</p>
               <p>Law 12,788/2013 provides for accelerated depreciation for specific assets, acquired or ordered between 30 September and 31 December 2012, to comprise the fixed assets of the taxpayer and to be used in the transportation of cargo and merchandise. Under article 1 of Law 12,788/2013, the depreciation for tax purposes would be calculated based on the general depreciation rate usually adopted for each specific asset multiplied by 3. The eligible assets are the vehicles listed in the Law, including some types of trucks, trains and railway cars.</p>
               <p>Law 12,794/2013 provides for accelerated depreciation for specific assets, acquired or ordered between 30 September and 31 December 2012, to comprise the fixed assets of the taxpayer and to be used in its activities. Under article 4 of Law 12,794/2013, the depreciation for tax purposes would be calculated based on the general depreciation rate usually adopted for each specific asset multiplied by 2. The assets may be depreciated until the acquisition cost is reduced to zero. There are 346 eligible assets listed in Decree 7,854/2012, including air generators, steam turbines, air compressors and reservoir tanks.</p>

The amounts deposited in the funds are invested in the purchase of securities issued by companies operating in the relevant regions.</p>
                  <p>Corporate taxpayers are entitled, after making the proper deposits, to receive securities representing interests in the pertinent fund, which may later be changed into securities belonging to the fund’s portfolio.

EPZs are industrial areas where companies therein established enjoy incentives regarding taxes and social contributions on condition that at least 80% of the production is exported.</p>
                  <p>Companies operating in EPZs are entitled to a temporary deferral of import-related taxes, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref> and the tax on financial transactions (<emph type="i">imposto sobre operações financeiras</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_iof">IOF</xref>), the freight surcharge for merchant marine renewal (AFRMM) and social security contributions related to imported or domestic goods and services acquired for use in the production process, under certain conditions. After 2 years, the deferral is converted into an exemption, unless it is proved that the company exported less than 80% of its production or if fixed assets acquired for the use in the production were sold before the 2-year period. In those cases, taxes previously deferred become due with interest and penalties.</p>

                  <p>The plans provide an attractive fringe benefit for employees – especially managers and those at the higher end of the pay scale – and important tax savings for the employer. The plans’ greatest benefits are tax advantages; in addition, a plan may be used as an incentive for employees for sales or performance.</p>
                  <p>Resources of PAITs organized by enterprises must be used in <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pait">PAIT</xref> investment funds or administered by an authorized institution (bank or brokerage house).

                  <p>Based on article 40 of the Transitory Constitutional Provisions, the government has established a free economic zone in Manaus (<emph type="i">Zona Franca de Manaus,</emph> ZFM) and grants a number of tax advantages to industries operating within such zone and to products manufactured or marketed therein. Under Constitutional Amendment 42/2003, such tax benefits may be effective until 2023 (instead of the limit originally determined by the Transitory Constitutional Provisions, which was 2013). The scheme is governed by Decree-Law 288/1967, regulated by Decree 61,244/1967.</p>
                  <p>The <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_zfm">ZFM</xref> is a free economic area for imports and exports established for the purpose of creating an industrial, commercial and agricultural centre within the Amazon Basin. The area of the free economic zone is defined by article 2 of Decree 61,244/1967, its main point of reference being the Port of Manaus, the left banks of the Negro and Amazon rivers, the Urubu river and the Cuieiras river.</p>
                  <p>Companies established at the ZFM are entitled to an exemption of import tax and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref> for goods imported for certain purposes, such as use in manufacturing other products, re-exportation, internal consumption or the operation of industries and performance of services. Goods used for other purposes than those listed in Decree-Law 288/1967 and Decree 61,244/1967, as well as goods imported through the ZFM for trade outside this zone, are subject to normal taxation. Exported goods are exempt from export duties.</p>
                  <p>Decree-Law 356/1988 extends the tax incentives granted under Decree-Law 288/1967 to goods received, improved or manufactured in the ZFM for local utilization and consumption in pioneer areas, frontier zones and other places of the West Amazon. The West Amazon consists of the states of Amazonas, Acre, Rondonia and Roraima.</p>
                  <p>These incentives are not available with respect to weapons and ammunition, perfumes, tobacco, alcoholic beverages and domestic products exported and subsequently imported through the ZFM.</p>
                  <p>The ZFM area is within the area of <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_sudam">SUDAM</xref> (i.e. the Amazon region), so that all tax incentives available for the SUDAM area are also available for the ZFM.</p>
                  <p>Other free trade zones (e.g. Santana Free Trade Zone, Boa Vista Free Trade Zone, etc.) exist, which compose the Amazon Free Trade Zones (<emph type="i">Áreas de Livre Comércio da Amazônia</emph>).</p>
                  <p>The applicability of the tax benefits in all free trade zone areas created until 11 August 2014 expires on 31 December 2050. The tax benefits granted within the free economic zone of Manaus expire in 2073.</p>

                  <p>On August 2011, and in the context of the global crisis that also had effects on the Brazilian economy, the Brazilian government launched the Greater Brazil Plan (<emph type="i">Plano Brasil Maior</emph>), which would guide some of the industrial, technological and foreign trade policies of the country in the coming years. As it was widely stated by the government, the intention of the plan was to sustain the growth of the Brazilian economy in the context of the unfavourable global scenario, in order to allow Brazil to exit the global crisis in a better position than it had entered.</p>
                  <p>In this scenario, besides several economic measures, the Greater Brazil Plan introduced several tax benefits, aiming at providing tax relief to specific business sectors deemed as key to the Brazilian economy and also to foster the consumption power of the citizens, so that more resources would circulate in the economy.</p>

                     <p>The regime applies to companies importing or purchasing in the internal market raw materials, intermediary products and packaging materials to be used in the industrialization process of goods used for the exploration, production and exploitation of oil, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons. Under this regime, the levy of <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pis">PIS</xref> and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cofins">COFINS</xref> is suspended for a period of 1 year (extendable to up to 5 years).</p>
                     <p>After the full use of the good for the purpose required by the law (i.e. exploration, production and exploitation of oil, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons), the suspension is converted into exemption or zero rating.</p>
                     <p>The regime is valid until 31 December 2040.</p>

                  <p>Article 12 of Law 11,945/2009 provides for a drawback regime, under which import duty, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pis">PIS</xref> and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cofins">COFINS</xref> normally levied on the import or purchase of goods in the internal market are suspended, provided that the said goods are used or consumed in the manufacturing of products to be exported. The regime is granted for the period of 1 year, which may be extended for another year (longer periods may be granted for certain products requiring longer period of production). The suspension of taxes is converted into exemption upon the actual export of the products. </p>
                  <p>In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the drawback regime term’s ending in 2021 was extended by 1 year (Provisional Measure 1,079/2021).</p>

Under these regimes, beneficiaries may import or buy in the domestic market, with the suspension of payment of taxes, goods to be industrialized for export or sales in the domestic market. To remain a beneficiary of the regimes, companies must export industrialized products at the minimum annual amount equivalent to 50% of the total amount of the goods admitted to the regime. In addition, they must use, during the industrialization process, at least 70% of admitted goods annually. The regime is granted for the period of 1 year, which may be extended for another year (longer periods may be granted for certain products requiring longer period of production).</p>

               <p>Therefore, it is common to say that <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> is imposed at a maximum aggregate rate of 34% (for non-financial companies). </p>
               <p>In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, a zero IRPJ and CSLL rate applies for entities under the emergency programme for the recovery of the events sector (<emph type="i">Programa Emergencial de Retomada do Setor de Eventos</emph>) (Law 14,148/2021 and Ordinance 7,163/2021).</p>
               <p>Under Bill 2337/2021, the reduction of the corporate income tax rates is being considered by the National Congress as follows: the standard IRPJ rate from 15% to 8% and the CSLL rate (gradually and conditioned to the removal of certain tax incentives) from (i) 9% to 8% in general, (ii) 20% to 19% for banks and (iii) 15% to 14% for other financial institutions, which reduces the aggregate rate from 34% to 26% (the 10% surtax for larger companies would remain unchanged).</p>
               <p>Under article 3 of Law 9,249/1995, the IRPJ is charged at a flat rate of 15%. However, under article 3(1) of Law 9,249/1995, as amended, all resident legal entities are subject to the IRPJ surtax at a flat rate of 10% on taxable profit exceeding the amount resulting from multiplying BRL 20,000 by the number of months of the relevant assessment period. Thus, for corporate taxpayers which have opted to pay income tax quarterly, the surtax applies on quarterly taxable profit exceeding BRL 60,000. Taxpayers which chose to assess their income tax annually and make monthly income tax payments are subject to the surtax on annual taxable profit exceeding BRL 240,000 and must make monthly payments on taxable profit exceeding BRL 20,000 a month. This surtax applies to all resident companies (including financial institutions) and farming enterprises.</p>

                     <p>The rates above are applicable to all kinds of fixed income investments. However, some specifics apply to fixed-income investment funds.</p>
                     <p>Additionally, Law 12,431/2011 introduced a special kind of debenture that may be issued by special purpose vehicles in specific situations outlined in article 2 of said law. Generally speaking, such debentures must be issued in view of specific infrastructure projects to be developed by the issuer and must comply with some requirements provided for in article 1 of Law 12,431/2011 (such as having a minimum average term greater than 4 years, pre-established interest rate, minimum term between interest payments of 180 days).</p>
                     <p>If the conditions are met, income arising from the investment in the debentures has a different tax treatment. In this case, the payments will be subject to withholding income tax at a 15% rate as final taxation with regard to the IRPJ (i.e. it is not subject to the regressive rates and such income should not be included in the taxable base of the IRPJ).</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, as the law did not mention the CSLL, the income received should be considered in the taxable base of the CSLL to be subject to a 9% rate (for financial institutions: 15% until 29 February 2020 and 20% as of 1 March 2020).</p>
                     <p>Therefore, investment in the qualifying debentures provides for a tax benefit related to the non-imposition of the IRPJ surtax.</p>

                     <p>The withholding income tax imposed on income arising out of the redemption of quotas of fixed-income investment funds depends on the classification of the fund as a short-term investment fund or a long-term investment fund.</p>
                     <p>For long-term investment funds, classified by the tax laws as those with a portfolio composed of fixed-income assets with an average redemption term exceeding 365 days, the withholding income tax is imposed based on regressive rates (22.5% to 15%), according to the lifetime of the transaction (same tax treatment of general fixed income investments).</p>
                     <p>Short-term investment funds, classified by the tax laws as those with portfolio composed of fixed-income assets with an average redemption term shorter than 365 days, are subject to the withholding income tax at regressive rates from 22.5% to 20%, according to the lifetime of the transaction. For transactions of 6 months or less, a 22.5% rate applies. For transactions of more than 6 months, a 20% rate applies.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding the imposition of the withholding income tax on the redemption of quotas, Brazilian tax laws also impose a half-year tax, regardless of effective distributions by the fund. Historically, investors in open-ended funds are subject to the automatic assessment of withholding tax on a semi-annual basis (on the last day of May and November – the so-called <emph type="i">come quotas</emph>) at the rates of 15% or 20% (depending on the classification of the portfolio of the fund) and regardless of the actual distribution of cash from the fund to the investor. On the other hand, investors in closed-end funds were generally subject to the assessment of withholding tax only upon the redemption, amortization or disposition of the quotas of the fund.</p>
                     <p>Upon redemption of the quotas of investment funds, the complementary withholding income tax is applied (in order to reach the regressive rates in view of the lifetime of the investment). The chart below summarizes the effects of the withholding income tax in those cases.</p>

                     <p>Income arising from share funds and other variable income investment funds, such as a private equity fund, are subject to the withholding income tax at a 15% rate, at the time of redemption of the quotas, provided that the requirements established by Brazilian tax law, and the regulations of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cvm">CVM</xref>, are met.</p>
                     <p>As a general rule, an investment fund (mutual investment funds and investment clubs, amongst others) the portfolio of which is composed for at least 67% of shares of publicly held companies and other securities is regarded as a share fund and taxed at a 15% rate.</p>
                     <p>With regard to private equity funds, the regulations of the CVM currently require that at least 90% of the portfolio of the fund be invested in shares and other securities.</p>
                     <p>If the requirements of the tax law and the CVM are not met, the tax treatment of the fund is the same as that of regular fixed-income funds.</p>

                     <title>Portfolio transactions performed on the stock exchange market and the organized over-the counter market</title>
                     <p>Gains arising out of the disposal of investments on the stock exchange and the organized over-the-counter market are treated as net gains by Brazilian tax laws and added to the CIT taxable base.</p>
                     <p>However, disposal of the investments is subject to a withholding income tax, which is imposed at a Brazilian Revenue Service 0.005% rate. The intention of such withholding income tax is to allow Brazilian tax authorities to better inspect the transactions performed on the stock exchange and the organized over-the-counter market, considering that the net gains arising from such transactions are fully subject to self-collection mechanisms.</p>
                     <p>The taxable base for the imposition of the 0.005% withholding income tax varies in accordance with the market on which the transaction was performed (i.e. spot market, futures market, forward contracts, etc.), as follows:</p>

                        <item label="-">
                           <p>in futures markets, tax is imposed on the positive algebraic sum of the mark-to-market values at the closing of the position, whether prematurely or upon maturity;</p>

                        <item label="-">
                           <p>in forward contracts: (1) when there is a physical delivery of the asset, the positive difference between the forward price and the spot price on the transaction date, and (2) if there is only financial settlement of the asset, the financial settlement value provided for in the contract; and</p>

               <title>Tax returns</title>
               <p>Brazil uses the self-assessment system under which all companies must file a tax return and declare their own tax liability. Legal entities must electronically file the Digital Tax Bookkeeping (<emph type="i">Escrituração Contábil Digital</emph>, ECD) and the Fiscal Tax Bookkeeping (<emph type="i">Escrituração Contábil Fiscal</emph>, ECF) by the last working days of May and July of the year following the taxable year (in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the deadlines for 2022 have been postponed to the last business days of June and August, respectively).</p>
               <p>Legal entities adopting the <emph type="i">Simples Nacional </emph>regime for the collection of taxes (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.2.1.">1.2.1.</xref>) and inactive entities may submit a simplified tax return. Charitable institutions and non-profit organizations, even though exempt from income tax, must also file the annual tax return.</p>
               <p>Companies applying the actual profit regime may elect to adopt a quarterly taxable period or elect to compute taxable profit on an annual basis with monthly payments of an estimated <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> calculated on their turnover. Under both options, entities must also report their results annually and file an annual tax return.</p>
               <p>Agents of non-resident entities must file a separate declaration for the profit earned in Brazil on behalf of their principal.</p>
               <p>Returns are also required from entities upon termination of their activities and the execution of merger or spin-off transactions.</p>
               <p>On 1 October 2012, tax authorities introduced the Alert Program (<emph type="i">Programa Alerta</emph>) allowing taxpayers the possibility to amend filing mistakes in the tax returns and tax ascertainment before a tax inspection is started.</p>
               <p>Tax authorities are willing to inform, prior to establishing a tax inspection, the inconsistencies found upon the data crossing performed by the tax authorities’ electronic systems. The existence of conflicts between the amount informed in the tax return and the one obtained by the tax authorities controls will be promptly informed to taxpayers with the procedures on how to amend/review their declarations.</p>
               <p>Initially, three transaction groups were elected to the Alert Program:</p>
               <list>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>revenue from sales to the federal administration;</p>
                  </item>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>inconsistencies related to liquor and beverage business sector; and</p>
                  </item>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>exempt entities (charity entities).</p>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Tax authorities expect to encourage taxpayers to review the tax declarations, and in case of inconsistencies, to promote the self-amendment of the amount informed in order to avoid inspections and possible litigation procedure. The amended tax return does not trigger penalties and can be performed until a tax inspection is formally initialized.</p>
               <p>Corporate taxpayers are required to keep their tax books and other supporting documents of the transactions performed for the time of the statute of limitations of the corresponding obligations. The statute of limitations under Brazilian tax laws is 5 years.</p>
               <p>Companies must also report their foreign trade transaction in specific systems controlled and monitored by tax authorities. In this sense, transactions involving the export and import of goods must be informed in the Foreign Trade Integrated System (<emph type="i">Sistema Integrado de Comércio Exterior, </emph>SISCOMEX), which is currently regulated by Normative Instruction 1,288/2012. The SISCOMEX is a tool used by Brazilian tax authorities to inspect foreign trade transactions and the collection of taxes arising from those transactions.</p>
               <p>An electronic system existed for the registration of cross-border transactions with services, intangibles and other situations that may have impacts to the equity of Brazilian taxpayers (such as lease agreements and other types of transactions) – the Integrated System for the foreign trade of services, intangibles and other transactions that have impacts to one’s equity (<emph type="i">Sistema Integrado de Comércio Exterior de Serviços, Intangíveis e Outras Operações que Produzam Variações no Patrimônio</emph>, SISCOSERV). However, on 17 August 2020, the Ministry of Finance and the tax authorities announced that, in order to reduce ancillary obligations and the tax compliance burden for taxpayers, the SISCOSERV would be shut down. On 21 October 2020, SISCOSERV was officially abolished through Ordinance 22,091/2020.</p>
               <p>The penalty for failure to attend a request for information issued by the tax authority within the deadlines provided in the request is BRL 500 per month.</p>
               <p>The penalty for failure to provide accurate and complete information is 3% on the commercial or financial transactions related to the legal entity or to third persons for which the legal entity is responsible for tax purposes. The corresponding amount cannot be lower than BRL 100.</p>

                  <title>Administrative level</title>
                  <p>Taxpayers may challenge a tax administration’s assessment by filing a written appeal with the local office of the tax administration within a 30-day period from the official acknowledgement of issuance of the tax assessment. The taxpayer’s appeal is decided at the first level by the head of the subregional judgement office (<emph type="i">Delegado de Julgamento da Receita Federal do Brasil</emph>). The appeals from financial institutions and equivalent entities are decided at the first level by the head of the Special Office of Financial Institutions (<emph type="i">Delegado Especial das Instituições Financeiras</emph>).</p>
                  <p>The taxpayer may challenge the decision of the head of the tax administration within a 30-day period of its formal acknowledgment by filing a voluntary appeal with the administrative court of tax appeals (<emph type="i">Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais</emph>). The administrative tax court is an administrative independent body composed of public officials (members of the tax administration) appointed by the Ministry of Finance and citizens, representing the taxpayer, which are appointed by private associations.</p>
                  <p>Decisions of the administrative court of tax appeals may be appealed against within 5 days in the case of a motion for clarification (<emph type="i">embargos de declaração</emph>) or 15 days for a special appeal (<emph type="i">recurso especial</emph>), to the High Administrative Tax Court (<emph type="i">Câmara Superior de Recursos Fiscais</emph>), which is composed of the presidents and vice-presidents of the chambers of the administrative court of tax appeals. An appeal is permitted if the decision was based on an interpretation of tax law other than that given by one of the chambers of the administrative tax court or by the High Administrative Tax Court.</p>
                  <p>If the taxpayer is successful in the discussion with tax authorities at the administrative level, the tax assessment is cancelled and no further actions may be pursued by the tax authorities with regard to that matter.</p>

Accordingly, the procedure may be (i) unilateral, when Brazilian tax authorities are able to conclude the procedure after reviewing the subject or (ii) bilateral, when Brazilian tax authorities contact the competent authority of the treaty partner in order to find a solution for the case.</p>

                  <title>Payment of tax</title>
                  <p>The payment of tax depends on the regime adopted by the taxpayer for the collection of <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> (i.e. actual profit regime or presumed profit regime; <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.2.1.">1.2.1.</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Legal entities subject to CIT under the actual profit regime may choose to assess and pay the CIT on either a quarterly basis or an annual basis.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the assessment on a quarterly basis, the actual profit subject to CIT considers all transactions performed within the quarter, and the end of each quarter is viewed as the end of the assessment period. The CIT rates are than applied to said taxable base, and the payment of CIT must be made by the last working day of the month following the quarterly period.</p>
                  <p>If the annual basis is elected, the taxable base is calculated by applying a given percentage (which varies, depending on the activity of the company) on the monthly gross income, including capital gains and any other income, except the income already taxed (the percentages range from 8% to 32%, depending on the legal entity’s activity). The CIT rates are then fully applied to said base. The tax must be paid monthly by the last working day of the month following the assessment. The CIT collected is treated as an advance payment and may be credited against the final CIT liability to be assessed on 31 December (when the taxable event is really deemed to occur). During the year, if the taxpayer believed that it is collecting more CIT based on the estimate than if the actual profit were considered, it may stop the collection of the estimate based on a reduction or suspension balance sheet. In this situation, an intermediary balance sheet is prepared by the company in which all of the transactions performed up to that moment are considered and the effective CIT due is calculated. If the taxpayer has collected more CIT based on the estimate than the CIT due based on the actual calculation according to the balance sheet, the taxpayer may suspend the collection of the estimates until there is an equalization of the tax due.</p>
                  <p>If upon the final assessment of the CIT on 31 December there are any outstanding amounts to be collected by the taxpayer, such CIT must be collected up to the last day of March of the following year. On the other hand, if the CIT collected throughout the year was higher than the final CIT liability assessed on 31 December, the excess CIT may be either (i) offset against the CIT due by April of the following year or (ii) reimbursed in cash to the taxpayer or offset against other federal taxes upon a specific request.</p>
                  <p>With regard to CIT to be paid on a quarterly or annual basis (including the monthly estimate payments), the legal entity may consider the withholding income tax paid in connection with the income included in the taxable base.</p>
                  <p>The election for the assessment of CIT on a quarterly or annual basis must be made upon the payment of the first instalment of the CIT in the year and may only be changed for the subsequent year.</p>
                  <p>Legal entities subject to the CIT under the presumed profit regime are required to assess and collect the CIT on a quarterly basis, therefore considering the transactions performed within the quarter for purposes of defining the taxable revenue to be subject to the presumed percentages (which is the taxable base of the presumed profit regime). The CIT rates are than applied.</p>
                  <p>Under the presumed profit regime, the taxpayer is allowed to adopt the cash method for the recognition of revenue with regard to the transactions performed and contracted for receipt in instalments. Therefore, in a given quarter, the taxable base will only consider the amounts effectively received by the taxpayer.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the CIT to be paid for each quarter, the legal entity may consider the withholding income tax paid in connection with the income included in the taxable base.</p>
                  <p>The CIT must be collected up to the last business day of the month following the quarter to which the CIT is related.</p>
                  <p>The election for assessment of the CIT under the presumed profit regime must be made upon the payment of the first instalment of CIT in the year and may only be changed for the subsequent year.</p>
                  <p>In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the deadlines for payment of federal taxes under the <emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph> regime were postponed by 3 months in 2020 and 2021.</p>

                  <p>Under Complementary Law 118/2005, a 5-year limitation period, counted from the date when the tax was paid, applies for taxpayers to claim the refund or offsetting of unduly paid taxes.</p>
                  <p>There was a discussion as to whether said Law could be applied retroactively (considering that a 10-year limitation applied before its enactment) or only with regard to taxes collected after the Law entered into force.</p>
                  <p>A decision of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_stf">STF</xref> rejected the retroactive application of the 5-year limitation, so that the refund with regard to taxes collected prior to Complementary Law 118/2005 remains subject to the 10-year statute of limitations, while claims filed after the law came into effect (9 June 2005) will be subject to the 5-year statute of limitations. This decision is final and binding to the taxpayers and tax authorities.</p>
                  <p>If the tax administration refuses the claim, the taxpayer may engage in administrative litigation with regard to said credit and follow the general route applicable to tax assessments.</p>

                  <p>On 12 December 2014, the Supreme Federal Court confirmed that tax penalties exceeding 100% of the value of the tax due are unconstitutional. The decision, given in the Extraordinary Appeal 833106/GO, concerned a state tax (i.e. not an income tax) of which the tax penalty amounted to 120%. The Court considered that the levy of penalties exceeding the amount of the tax due was a violation of the constitutional principle that forbids confiscation by the state. The decision is binding only on the parties involved, but may serve as a precedent for complaints regarding tax penalties above 100% of the tax (including income tax) due imposed by federal, state and municipal authorities.</p>
                  <p>Taxpayers with tax debts under the special administrative collection procedure (i.e. taxpayers with tax debts over BRL 10 million) are subject to additional non-monetary penalties in case they do not regularize their tax debts (e.g. restrictions imposed by financial institutions on granting public credit and financing and exclusion from special programmes for the payment of tax debts).</p>

               <p>A request for an advance ruling relies on the right to petition, guaranteed under article 5(XXXIV)(a) of the Federal Constitution. This provision establishes that the right to petition the public authorities to defend one’s rights is guaranteed to all people.</p>
               <p>For an advance tax ruling to be considered valid, it is necessary to clearly identify the uncertainty to be addressed by tax authorities, and such uncertainty must be justified by the taxpayer with regard to a certain and specific fact. That is, in theory, an advance tax ruling cannot decide on general aspects but rather only on specific situations faced by the taxpayer.</p>
               <p>Matters that have already been reviewed by the tax authorities or that are the subject matter of an interpretation expressed under administrative rules cannot be the subject of an advance ruling. Actually, the purpose of an advance ruling is to clarify an uncertainty of the taxpayer, leading it to adopt a certain procedure based on the interpretation of the tax authorities, therefore avoiding litigation in the future.</p>
               <p>As this is a preventive measure, the immediate effect of requesting an advance ruling is that it prevents the tax authorities from filing any tax procedure against the taxpayer with regard to the issue under consultation, from the date the request for advance ruling is filed up to the 30th day following the final decision on said request (article 48 of Decree-Law 70,235/1972).</p>
               <p>Moreover, should the response to the request for an advance ruling be unfavourable to the taxpayer, meaning that taxes are payable, article 161(2) of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ctn">CTN</xref> provides that these tax liabilities will not be subject to penalties or interest if spontaneously collected by the taxpayer after the decision. This is because filing of the request for an advance ruling stays the term for payment of the taxes until the tax authorities pronounce an opinion on the matter. Decisions are binding only for the requesting taxpayer.</p>
               <p>Decree 8,853/2016 amended the regulations on the consultation procedure to establish that taxpayers may also question the classification of goods, services and intangibles based on the Brazilian classification of service, intangibles and other transactions for international trade purposes. Another relevant change incorporated by said decree is related to reimbursement of tax requests relating to anti-dumping rights that now must be judged by the Brazilian Revenue Service. Decree 8,853/2016 also determined that the Brazilian Revenue Service has up to 360 days, counted from the date of the protocol, to decide on the consultation request. </p>
               <p>The exchange of information on tax rulings (within the framework of improving transparency relating to rulings under Action 5 of the BEPS Action Plan of the OECD on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) was implemented and regulated by Normative Instruction 1,689/2017. According to the OECD peer review report released on 4 December 2017, Brazil has met all aspects of the terms of reference for the year in review, except with respect to the timely provision of future rulings to the competent authority. However, as no future rulings were issued in this period, there has been no practical impact on the effectiveness of Brazil’s implementation of the transparency framework. No recommendation is made as Brazil has addressed this issue by ensuring that future rulings will be identified after they are issued.</p>

                  <title>Mutual agreement procedure</title>
                  <p>Normative Instruction 1,669/2016 introduced formal regulations to the mechanism for solving tax treaty controversies (<xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_map">MAP</xref>). Accordingly, any Brazilian resident – individual or corporate – may present the requirement for a formal procedure whenever it is understood that the application of the tax treaty is not in accordance with the wording of the agreement and there is no administrative or judicial ruling on the matter.</p>

               <title>Tax audit/examination</title>
               <p>The tax authorities can examine documents or request information from any taxpayer. The procedure for tax audit is ruled by Decree 70,235/1972 (Administrative Fiscal Procedure Ruling). Through this procedure, tax authority officers are able to investigate tax returns, books and invoices, and collect information about legal entities and transactions. The access by tax authorities to taxpayers' information held by financial institutions for tax investigation purposes is regulated by Decree 3,724/2014. Accordingly, tax authorities are allowed to examine taxpayers' information in documents, books, and registries of financial institutions (including information on deposit accounts and financial investments), provided that a tax audit is ongoing and such information is considered indispensible for the tax audit.</p>
               <p>Decree 3,724/2014 lists the situations in which the access to information is considered indispensible for the tax audit, such as in the case of lack of documentation justifying loans with non-financial institutions and transactions engaged with persons resident of low-tax jurisdictions. On 5 September 2014, Decree 8,303/2014 amended Decree 3,724/2014 to add the following situations to the mentioned list:</p>
               <list>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>transactions engaged with persons who benefit from a privileged tax regime, as defined by the Brazilian tax legislation; and</p>
                  </item>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>exchange of information required on the basis of international treaties, agreements or protocols for the purpose of tax inspection and collection.</p>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The tax audit starts with a notification sent by tax authorities to the legal entity in order to indicate that the procedure will take place. This notification can indicate a tax examination procedure (<emph type="i">mandado de procedimento fiscal – fiscalização</emph>) or a specific diligence audit (<emph type="i">mandado de procedimento fiscal – diligência</emph>). If the tax authorities believe that the legal entity may hide proof or evidence, the procedure can be initiated without any previous notification.</p>
               <p>According to Decree 8,303/2014, before accessing the information, tax authorities must notify taxpayers, who may respond by either: </p>
               <list>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>authorizing the direct access by tax authorities to the information held by financial institutions; or</p>
                  </item>
                  <item label="-">
                     <p>voluntarily presenting such information, with the confirmation of its veracity and integrity and of observation of applicable penal law.</p>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The access to such information may be requested by the Brazilian tax authorities by means of a notification to the President of the Brazilian Central Bank, the President of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission, the President of the Financial Institution or to the manager of the branch of the financial institution.</p>
               <p>After the conclusion of the audit, the tax authorities may decide, upon the information collected, to issue a tax assessment against the legal entity. In this case, the company can present its defence by filing a written appeal against the assessment at the local office of the tax administration (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.11.3.">1.11.3.</xref>). </p>
               <p>Some specific taxpayers are subject to “differentiated” and “special” tax monitoring rules, which consist in periodical cross-checking of macroeconomic variables, the taxpayer’s economic-tax behaviour and information regarding the taxpayers’ collection of listed taxes and contributions, for the purpose of verifying any inconsistencies. Those rules apply to major taxpayers, taxpayers with large debts before tax authorities, taxpayers with significant payroll, among others. According to Ordinance 5,018/2020, published in the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_dou">DOU</xref> of 24 December 2020, the “differentiated” tax monitoring is applicable in 2021 to corporate taxpayers that meet at least one of the following conditions:</p>

                  <item label="-">

               </list>
               <p>Besides these criteria, the tax authorities may also apply parameters for selecting companies for “differentiated” and “special” tax monitoring in 2021.</p>

                  <title>Access to bank information</title>
                  <p>According to article 5 of the Federal Constitution, bank details can only be revealed upon the request of a judicial court during a judicial proceeding. However, on 24 February 2016, the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_stf">STF</xref> concluded the judgment of five actions questioning the constitutionality of article 6 of Complementary Law 105/2001 (<emph type="i">Lei Complementar</emph> 105/2001), which authorizes tax authorities to access taxpayers' bank information during administrative proceedings. By a majority of votes, the Court decided for the constitutionality of the rule and, as a result, confirmed tax authorities' right to access taxpayers' bank information without the need of a prior judicial order issued by a judicial court. The decisions were given in Extraordinary Appeal <emph type="i">(Recurso Extraordinário</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_re">RE</xref>) 601,304 and Direct Actions for Unconstitutionality (<emph type="i">Ação Direta de Inconstitucionalidade</emph>, ADI) 2390, 2386, 2397 e 2859. </p>
                  <p>By allowing access to bank information during administrative proceedings (i.e. without judicial order), Complementary Law 105/2001 violates the bank secrecy rule in the constitutional article. The Court stated that there is no violation of taxpayers' bank secrecy in view of the fact that tax authorities are obliged to respect fiscal secrecy. In this regard, according to the Court, access to bank information by tax authorities means only the exchange of secret information between two organs that are bound by the same obligation of secrecy.</p>
                  <p>The decisions in the Direct Actions for Unconstitutionality have effect on all taxpayers.</p>

               <p>
                  <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_csll">CSLL</xref> is established in article 195(I) of the Federal Constitution and is governed by Law 7,689/1988, as modified by Law 8,034/1990 and Law 11,727/2008.</p>
               <p>CSLL is imposed on corporate taxpayers and, in theory, it is destined to finance the federal social security system.</p>
               <p>The taxable base of the CSLL is very similar to the taxable base of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_irpj">IRPJ</xref> for taxpayers subject to the actual profit regime. The difference relies on minor inclusions and deductions that are specific for CSLL purposes. For this reason, the CSLL is generally viewed as an actual income tax.</p>
               <p>With regard to companies subject to the presumed profit regime, the taxable base of the CSLL is 12% of their monthly gross revenue (same percentage applicable to the IRPJ), with regard to commercial companies in general and 32% of the gross revenue, with regard to companies engaged in the rendering of services. Capital gains and other income are fully added to the taxable base.</p>
               <p>Under Law 9,316/1996, CSLL may not be deducted from the IRPJ taxable base nor from its own taxable base.</p>
               <p>The use of accumulated losses follows the same principles of the IRPJ.</p>
               <p>The prevailing opinion among tax scholars and of case law of the administrative courts was that the CSLL was only covered by tax treaties signed by Brazil before the introduction of CSLL on 1 January 1989. In the <emph type="i">Oxiteno</emph> case, regarding the treaties signed by Brazil with Austria and Spain, the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_carf">CARF</xref> decided that the CSLL is covered by such treaties because it was created before the countries signed their treaties and it was substantially similar to income tax. However, a different chamber of the same court decided that the CSLL is not covered by the treaties signed by Brazil with Austria and Spain because it is not a tax but a social contribution and the treaties were only meant to cover taxes. With regard to tax treaties signed after 1 January 1989, the CSLL would only be included in the substantive scope if it was expressly mentioned either in the treaty in the list of taxes covered or in the protocol. In view of the different opinions, Law 13,202/2015 finally stated that, for interpretation purposes, tax treaties concluded by Brazil do include the CSLL in their substantive scope.</p>

                  <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cofins">COFINS</xref> was created by Complementary Law 70/1991, as amended by Complementary Law 85/1996 and Laws 9,718/1998 and 10,833/2003, and is regulated by Normative Instruction 1,911/2019.</p>
               <p>COFINS is a contribution imposed on all legal entities and, in theory, it is destined to finance the social security system.</p>
               <p>COFINS is imposed on the taxpayer’s gross revenue, regardless of the source and denomination. Under the applicable laws, some items may be deducted from the taxable base, such as the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref> and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_icms">ICMS</xref> (the exclusion of ICMS from the taxable base was confirmed by the Federal Supreme Court in Appeal 574,706), cancelled sales, restitutions, income from the sale of fixed assets and non-conditional discounts. On top of that, income from the export of goods and services is not subject to COFINS. For the purpose of this exemption, Normative Ruling 1/2018 clarified that export of services occurs when the renderer of the service "operates from the domestic market" using his own means available in national territory in order to meet a "demand from another (foreign) market" in favour of "the service taker that operates in such other (foreign) market". Accordingly, the renderer of the service "operates from the domestic market" when he initiates the provision of the service in the national territory through preparatory acts prior to the material rendering of the service, such as to the planning, identification of the indispensable expertise or the mobilization of the material and intellectual resources necessary for the service. The service taker "operates in the foreign market" when its demand for the service occurs abroad and must be satisfied outside the national territory.</p>
               <p>Law 13,043/2014, broadened the definition of gross income for the purpose of COFINS by including any revenue connected to the core activity of the company.</p>
               <p>There are two distinct regimes for the assessment and collection of COFINS. The first, regulated by Law 9,718/1998, is the cumulative regime and the second, introduced by Law 10,833/2003, is called the non-cumulative regime.</p>
               <p>Under the cumulative regime, COFINS is imposed at a general 3% rate on the taxpayers’ gross revenue, without the deduction of any credits. The cumulative regime is mandatory for legal entities adopting the presumed profit regime for <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> purposes. Additionally, financial institutions are also obliged to adopt the cumulative regime but, with regard to those entities, a 4% rate applies.</p>
               <p>Still in connection with the assessment of COFINS by financial institutions, the applicable laws and regulations (mainly IN 1,285/2012 and IN 1,544/2015) provides for several exclusions from the taxable basis, so that the effective COFINS rate is usually lower than 4%.</p>
               <p>Under the non-cumulative regime, COFINS is imposed at a 7.6% rate over the taxpayers’ gross revenue but, in this case, the deduction of credits expressly listed under article 3 of Law 10,833/2003 is allowed. The idea of the non-cumulative regime is to reduce the effects of the imposition of COFINS with regard to the several stages of the production chain.</p>
               <p>The COFINS non-cumulative regime, however, is not a straightforward offsetting regime, under which all amounts previously paid with regard to one good or service within the production chain may be used as a credit. In fact, COFINS credits are calculated via the application of the 7.6% rate over the amounts incurred for the acquisition of inputs, lease and rental payments, and electricity, among other items listed by article 3 of Law 10,833/2003.</p>
               <p>Despite of the tax authorities’ restrictive interpretation of the concept of inputs, a broader concept has been applied by the Superior Court of Justice decisions, the most recent one issued on 22 February 2018. The Superior Court of Justice decision follows the same reasoning already applied by the lower courts, according to which expenses that are essential for providing the services or producing the goods should be taken into consideration for assessing the credits, even when they are not listed. These decisions could lead to a new trend to conceptualize inputs for COFINS purposes with a more beneficial approach towards taxpayers.</p>
               <p>Until 30 June 2015, financial income derived by companies subject to COFINS under the non-cumulative regime was subject to those contributions at a 0% rate (except for the receipt of interest on net equity from domestic subsidiaries). However, as of 1 July 2015, the rate is increased from 0% to 4% by Decree 8,426/2015. The 0% rate remained, though, for financial income derived from foreign exchange fluctuation related to the following transactions: (i) exports of goods and services, (ii) liabilities resulting from loans and financing agreements and (iii) hedging transactions carried out on the stock exchange, futures or over-the-counter market for the purpose of protecting the investor against price or rate variations, provided that the contract: (a) is related to the operational activities developed by the legal entity and (b) aims at protecting the legal entity’s rights and liabilities.</p>
               <p>The constitutionality of the 4% rate levied on financial income was under discussion at the Superior Court of Justice (in Appeal RESP 1,586,950), in view of the fact that COFINS tax rates can only be raised under a law (not a decree) in accordance with the constitutional principle of strict legality. However, on 9 October 2017, the Superior Court of Justice ruled that Law 10,865/2004 authorizes the Federal Executive Branch to increase, reduce and restore COFINS rates by decree and, therefore, the increase is constitutional.</p>
               <p>The non-cumulative regime is mandatory for those entities assessing the CIT based on the actual profit regime. However, with regard to some specific revenues, COFINS is due based on the cumulative regime (even if the general regime adopted by the taxpayer is the non-cumulative one). In this sense, the revenues derived in view of the performance of public transportation services, educational services, marketing and call centre services, travel agent services, among several others listed in article 10 of Law 10,833/2003, are subject to the cumulative regime.</p>
               <p>In addition to that, with regard to some specific activities, COFINS is imposed based on specific rates and taxable basis, such as in connection with the sale by importers and producers of petroleum-based products and ethanol. In those cases, the rates vary in accordance with the type of product and whether or not the party is a producer or an importer. Currently, the rates vary from 6.9% to 47.4%, depending on the type of product. Some special regimes for the collection of COFINS are also available with regard to the sale of ethanol and petroleum products, under which the COFINS contribution is calculated based on a fixed price multiplied by the number of cubic metres or tons involved in the transaction.</p>
               <p> <emph type="i">See</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.9.">1.9.</xref> for some relevant tax incentives related to COFINS. In any case, there are other special regimes and tax incentives applicable to specific situations and activities developed by corporate taxpayers. Indeed, there are several exemptions and 0% rates applicable to specific products and services, based on their description and tax classification codes.</p>
               <p>Law 10,833/2003 also created a withholding tax regime for COFINS in respect of certain service payments, including those for cleaning, security, professional and credit services. The withholding tax is treated as an advance payment of the COFINS liability. IN 459/2004 establishes the rules for taxpayers in respect of this withholding tax regime. For details on the withholding obligations, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.10.3.4.">1.10.3.4.</xref> </p>
               <p>Finally, Law 10,865/2004 introduced the imposition of COFINS in connection with the import of goods and services by Brazilian corporate taxpayers. The COFINS-Import is not imposed on gross revenue but rather on the customs value of the imported good or the price of the contracted services. The taxable base of the COFINS-Import levied on the import of goods is the customs value of the goods. Previously, the value of the imported goods for the purpose of the COFINS-Import was determined on the basis of a formula laid down by the federal tax authorities, which took into account the value of the goods and the taxes levied on their import. The taxable base of the COFINS-Import levied on the import of services remains, however, calculated on the basis of such a formula, disclosed by the federal tax authorities (Normative Instructions 572/2005 and 1,401/2013). The import of services for the purpose of COFINS-Import is considered to exist when services are executed in Brazil or when they are executed outside Brazil but the “result” is verified in Brazil. There is controversy in respect of what “result” means for the purpose of this rule, which can lead to discussions on the levy of COFINS-Import.</p>
               <p>Several private rulings (e.g. Private Rulings 316/2017 and 74/2019) clarify that the outbound payment, credit, delivery or remittance of royalties is not subject to COFINS-Import. For this purpose, the term “royalties” is understood to include income from the licensing of the use of software. If technical service or assistance is also provided (mixed contract), COFINS-Import is levied on the related fees, provided that these amounts are separately identified in the contract. If the contract is not clear in respect of what amount is related to royalties and what amount is related to the provision of technical service and assistance, the total amount of the contract will be deemed to be fees for technical service and assistance and will, thus, be subject to COFINS-Import.</p>
               <p>According to Private Ruling 153/2017, the taxable event triggering COFINS-Import of services occurs upon the payment, credit, delivery or remittance of the income to the non-resident person. In the specific case of credit, it is sufficient for the configuration of the taxable event that the paying source in Brazil registers the payment obligation in its accounting records. Private Ruling 544/2018 clarified that there is no levy of COFINS-Import in the case of a payment made by a non-resident person to another non-resident person for services provided to a resident of Brazil. </p>
               <p>According to Law 13,137/2015, the standard rate levied on the import of goods is 9.65%. The import of listed products may also trigger rates higher than the standard 9.65% (e.g. certain medications and vaccines are taxed at the rate of 13.03%; listed perfumery, toiletries and personal hygiene products are taxed at the rate of 16.48%; listed machines and vehicles at the rate of 12.57%). The import of service is subject to the standard rate of 7.6%. </p>
               <p>With regard to taxpayers assessing COFINS based on the non-cumulative regime, the amounts paid as a COFINS-Import may be discounted as credits for the assessment of COFINS due in connection with the taxpayers’ gross revenue. Law 12,973/2014 clarified that income arising from the sale of long-term assets is not subject to COFINS (the same applies to fixed assets).</p>
               <p>An additional 1% rate of COFINS applies from 1 April 2022 to 31 December 2023 on the import of certain products (e.g. shoes, fur and leather, gloves, vehicles, parachutes) (Law 14,288/2021) - this additional 1% rate had been previously levied but was subsequently revoked by Provisional Measure 774/2017.</p>
               <p>Until 31 December 2022, a zero COFINS rate applies on internal transactions and the import of listed types of fuels (e.g. diesel, biodiesel, liquefied petroleum gas, petroleum derivatives and natural gas).</p>
               <p>In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, a zero COFINS rate applies for entities under the emergency programme for the recovery of the events sector (<emph type="i">Programa Emergencial de Retomada do Setor de Eventos</emph>) (Law 14,148/2021 and Ordinance 7,163/2021).</p>
               <p>Companies are required to specify on invoices and receipts the taxes charged (percentages), which are part of the total amount of the product’s sales price or the price for the provision of services, including COFINS. In this sense, companies must list the amount of municipal, state and federal taxes levied for each product described in the invoices and receipts sold. Alternatively, such information could also be displayed on a panel in plain view within their establishments. Companies failing to comply with these requirements are subject to administrative penalties.</p>

               <p>
                  <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pis">PIS</xref> was created by Complementary Laws 7/1970 and 8/1988. This contribution is regulated by Laws 9,715/1998, 9,718/1998 and 10,637/2002, Provisional Measure 1,858-6/1999 and Normative Instruction 1,911/2019.</p>
               <p>Corporate taxpayers are subject to the PIS contribution, which is imposed based on their gross revenue. PIS is very similar to <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cofins">COFINS</xref> in connection with the mechanics for its assessment and collection – the reason why they are jointly referred to. In this sense, as it happens with COFINS, there are two distinct regimes for the assessment and collection of PIS. The first, regulated by Law 9,718/1998, is the cumulative regime and the second, introduced by Law 10,833/2003, is called the non-cumulative regime.</p>
               <p>Based on Law 9,718/98, under the cumulative regime, legal entities are subject to the imposition of PIS on their gross revenue at the rate of 0.65%. The same deductions for COFINS purposes are allowed for determining the PIS basis calculation (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.2.">2.3.2.</xref>). The 0.65% rate also applies for financial institutions and the provisions of IN 1,285/2012 also apply in order to allow some deduction in the taxable basis. Income from the export of goods and services is not subject to PIS. For the purpose of this exemption, Normative Ruling 1/2018 clarified the meaning of export of services, which is the same applicable for the purpose of the exemption from COFINS (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.2.">2.3.2.</xref>).</p>

               <p>Before 1 May 2015, import transactions involving goods and services were subject to PIS at the rate of 1.65%. However, Provisional Measure 668/2015 increased the standard rate levied on the import of goods to 2.1%. The import of listed products may also trigger rates higher than the standard 9.65% (e.g. certain medications and vaccines are taxed at the rate of 2.76%; listed perfumery, toiletries and personal hygiene products are taxed at the rate of 3.52%; listed machines and vehicles at the rate of 2.62%). The import of service continues to be subject to the standard rate of 1.65%. </p>
               <p>Until 31 December 2022, a zero PIS rate applies on internal transactions and the import of listed types of fuels (e.g. diesel, biodiesel, liquefied petroleum gas, petroleum derivatives and natural gas).</p>
               <p>In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, a zero PIS rate applies for entities under the emergency programme for the recovery of the events sector (<emph type="i">Programa Emergencial de Retomada do Setor de Eventos</emph>) (Law 14,148/2021 and Ordinance 7,163/2021).</p>

            <title>Social security contributions</title>
            <p>The Brazilian social security system is financed by the contributions of employers, employees and the federal government. Employers are required to pay social security contributions and charges based on the payroll (<emph type="i">see</emph> below) as well as contributions based on their gross income. For social contributions on gross revenue, <emph type="i">see</emph> sections <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.1.">2.3.1.</xref> to <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_2.3.3.">2.3.3.</xref> </p>

               <title>Contribution of the Employer to the Social Security (<emph type="i">Contribuição Patronal Previdenciária para a Seguridade Social</emph>)</title>
               <p>Employers are subject to a contribution to the social security system which is calculated based on a general 20% rate on the monthly payroll (according to the Federal Supreme Court, including the maternity leave salary in the taxable base is unconstitutional). There is no ceiling for these contributions. Financial institutions pay an additional 2.5% on their monthly payroll.</p>
               <p>Legal entities must also pay this contribution on the fees paid to any self-employed individuals as a consideration for the rendering of services.</p>
               <p>In addition to paying their own contribution of 20% on the monthly payroll, employers must also withhold and remit the social contributions of their employees and the self-employed individuals with whom they have contracted – for details, <emph type="i">see</emph> Individual Taxation sections <extxref publish="n" target="ita_br_s_3.1.">3.1.</extxref> and <extxref publish="n" target="ita_br_s_3.2.">3.2.</extxref> The contribution withheld in this case is limited to the application of the applicable rate to the contribution salary established by social security authorities (which is the basis for the imposition of the social security contributions due by the employees). For 2022, the maximum contribution salary is BRL 7,087.22.</p>
               <p>Under Law 9,711/1998, companies must also withhold 11% on the payments made to other companies for the rendering of specific services.</p>
               <p>Under Law 11,457/2007, the Brazilian Revenue Service (RFB) is responsible for managing the collection of the social contributions while the National Social Security Institute (INSS) only manages payment of social security benefits.</p>
               <p>Until 31 December 2023, certain business sectors may opt to collect social contribution on gross income instead of the standard social security contribution (<emph type="i">see</emph> below). </p>

               <title>Social Contribution on Gross Income (<emph type="i">Contribuição Previdenciária sobre a Receita Bruta</emph>, CPRB)</title>
               <p>Under Law 12,546/2011, as amended by Law 13,670/2018 and regulated by Normative Instructions 1,436/2013 and 1,812/2018, listed business sectors may opt to collect social contribution based on a percentage of their gross revenues (<emph type="i">Contribuição Previdenciária sobre a Receita Bruta</emph>, CPRB) instead of collecting the standard social contribution of 20% on the payroll – before 30 November 2015, the CPRB was not an option but obligatory. Under Law 12,546/2011 as amended by Laws 14,020/2020 and 14,288/2021, the option for the CPRB is available until 31 December 2023.</p>
               <p>According to Private Ruling 10,022/2015, for the applicability of the CPRB only the main economic activity of the entity is taken into consideration. As a result, entities are subject to CPRB, provided that the main economic activity figures in the list of activities subject to this contribution. The fact that the secondary activity is in the list of activities is not enough to trigger the levy of CPRB. Further, Private Ruling COSIT 193/2015 clarified that, in the case that no revenue was derived by the company in the previous calendar year, the main economic activity to be considered for the applicability of the CPRB is the one which is expected to produce the highest revenue among the activities described in the constitutive act of the company.</p>
               <p>Approximately 56 business sectors were initially entitled to this contribution based on gross income, but this number was significantly reduced by Law 13,670/2018. Currently, construction companies and infrastructure works, vehicles industry, machinery and equipment industry, textile, information technology, communication technology and freight transport services are among those still figuring in the list. The applicable rates vary from 1% to 4.5% according to the business sector or products manufactured. In case of the provision of certain services, companies must withhold 3.5% on payments made to companies subject to CPRB.</p>
               <p>As this mechanism is based on gross income from the products and services specifically listed by the government and not the entire activity developed by the taxpayer, entities engaged in the manufacturing of some listed and non-listed products must adopt a mixed system for the calculation of the social security contribution.</p>
               <p>The mechanism considers the specific products listed by the government and not the entire activity developed by the taxpayer. Therefore, entities that are engaged in the manufacturing of some listed and non-listed products must adopt a mixed system for the calculation of the social security contribution.</p>
               <p>For the purpose of calculating the social contribution, gross revenues are comprised of (i) the revenues arising from the rendering of services, (ii) the revenues arising from the sale of goods, and (iii) commissions and fees when the entity is acting on behalf of third parties in the sale of goods. However, the following should not be considered gross revenues: revenues arising from exports, cancelled sales, unconditional discounts and the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref> and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_icms">ICMS</xref> included in the prices charged by the taxpayer.</p>

               <title>Workers compensation insurance (<emph type="i">seguro de acidente do trabalho</emph>, SAT)</title>
               <p>A contribution to SAT must be made by employers for the purposes of providing compensation on the death or disability or for employment-related accidents of their employees.</p>
               <p>Employers must pay a monthly premium calculated on the payroll. The rates vary according to the level of accident risk related to the company business activity: 1% (low risk), 2% (medium risk) or 3% (high risk).</p>
               <p>As from 2010, Brazilian authorities introduced the accident prevention factor (<emph type="i">fator acindentário de prevenção</emph>, FAP), which must be taken into account in the definition of the amount due as SAT. The FAP may double the amount of the SAT contribution or reduce it by 50%, based on the number and seriousness of labour accidents that took place in the previous year.</p>

            <p>There are two different taxes on real estate – the municipal tax on real estate (<emph type="i">imposto sobre propriedade territorial urbana</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_iptu">IPTU</xref>) and the federal tax on rural land (<emph type="i">imposto territorial rural</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_itr">ITR</xref>). These taxes are mutually exclusive (the same property may not be subject to both at the same time).</p>
            <p>Privately owned buildings open to the general public (e.g. museums, private areas occupied by gardens or parks) are usually taxed at nominal rates or exempt from tax.</p>

               <p>Urban land and buildings are subject to a municipal real estate tax on a yearly basis.</p>
               <p>Real estate taxes on urban property are used not only to raise revenue but also as an indirect mean of enforcing municipal regulations in matters such as construction, housing and landscaping.</p>
               <p>The tax is levied on urban land and buildings, including land located within urban areas that is not used for agricultural or entertainment activities. The taxpayer is the owner of the property.</p>
               <p>For the purposes of this tax, the urban areas of a city or town are those having at least two of the requirements indicated by law, such as pavements, water mains, sewerage facilities, street lights and public schools within 1.5 miles of the property.</p>
               <p>The tax is assessed annually on the market value of the property, as disclosed by municipal tax authorities (<emph type="i">valor venal</emph>). The appraisal procedure is governed by law with varying degrees of sophistication depending on the municipality.</p>
               <p>Tax rates are determined by each municipality. The rates may vary considerably, e.g. from 0.5%, 1%, 2% to 3.5% and may be progressive in view of the value attributed to the property and its location.</p>

               <p>The federal tax on rural land (ITR) is provided for by article 153, VI of the Federal Constitution, currently governed by Law 9,393/1996, and it is imposed annually on the ownership or possession of rural land located outside the urban zone.</p>
               <p>ITR is a federal tax assessed by the Brazilian Revenue Service. Under article 153, paragraph 4 of the Federal Constitution, the ITR must have progressive rates and is destined to promote a more rational and intensive use of rural land.</p>
               <p>An exemption from ITR applies in respect of:</p>

The calculation of the taxable value of the bare land is defined by law and takes into account the amount resulting from the multiplication of the value of the bare land (value of the property after certain deductions, as declared by the land owner, based on market standards) by the ratio which the taxable area (value of the total area after certain deductions) bears to the total area.</p>
               <p>If tax authorities object to the value of bare land declared by the land owner, they may assess a taxable base for the imposition of the ITR, based on the price of other land in the same region and other information available in the RFB’s electronic system.</p>
               <p>The tax rates are provided by the Annex of Law 9,393/1996 and vary from 0.03% to 20% in accordance with the number of hectares of land and the ratio which the area actually used bears to the total useful area of the land.</p>

                  <title>Definition under domestic law</title>
                  <p>Brazilian tax law does not provide for a concept of permanent establishment. However, it allows non-residents to operate in Brazil upon the filing of a request with the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Development seeking an authorization to carry out business activities locally through branches, which are subject to tax in Brazil under the same rules applicable to resident companies.</p>
                  <p>In addition, and without making reference to the term permanent establishment, Brazilian tax law addresses situations under which a non-resident taxpayer may constitute a taxable presence in Brazil without being formally registered in the country. These rules are not expressly related to determining whether there is a permanent establishment in Brazil, although the tax authorities could, in principle, rely on them to assess <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> on local “taxable units” of non-residents. One situation refers to non-residents that are subject to corporate income taxes on profits derived in Brazil from the sale of imported goods through official representatives (<emph type="i">mandatários</emph>) or commissionaires (<emph type="i">comissários</emph>) (articles 159(3) and 468 of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_rir">RIR</xref>), or from the direct sale of imported goods through local agents or representatives (a type of agency permanent establishment) (articles 469 and 612 of the RIR). In this respect, Private Ruling 4/2013 (<emph type="i">Solução de Consulta or Processo de Consulta</emph>) confirmed that when the agent has binding powers and the invoicing is done directly by the non-resident, the profits of the non-resident enterprise are determined by applying a profit percentage on the gross revenue. This is the first guideline issued by tax authorities on the PE subject. However, this assessment and actual taxation does not happen in practice.</p>
                  <p>The other situation that may constitute a taxable presence in Brazil refers to the concept of a business or professional unit, where a person conducts business activities without being formally registered with the competent authorities to do so (unincorporated business unit). There is no definition of a business unit in the Brazilian tax legislation. However, under the Civil Code (articles 966, 982 and 986 of Law 10,406/2002), a business unit is the complex of assets aligned for conducting business activities. Although the Civil Code does not provide for details, such definition may serve as guidance to Brazilian tax authorities and taxpayers to determine whether or not the activities conducted locally by a non-resident qualify as a business unit.</p>
                  <p>Despite the lack of a definition of permanent establishments in the law, the country-by-country regulations (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.2.2.">10.2.2.</xref>) referred to a permanent establishment as a fixed business installation through which an entity exercises, wholly or partly, its business activity in a different jurisdiction (Normative Instruction 1,681/2016). The definition follows with a list of examples, including “a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, a mine or any place of extraction of minerals and a construction site only when it exceeds the period of 12 months”. While normative instructions are administrative acts that are hierarchically below the law, they may serve as a basis for the tax authorities to challenge operations that are not being taxed in Brazil.</p>
                  <p>Brazilian tax law does not allow non-residents to optionally carry out business in Brazil as a business unit. If Brazilian tax authorities verify that a non-resident is conducting business in Brazil as a business unit without registering its activities as prescribed by law, a tax assessment may be imposed on the non-resident. There are no court cases dealing with situations where a non-resident has entered into local business transactions through an unregistered business unit.</p>
                  <p>There are only few cases regarding the recognition of permanent establishments in Brazil – private rulings and administrative decisions (Private Ruling 4/2013 and Decisions <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_carf">CARF</xref> 2202-003.114 and 2202-003.063, both from 2016) and rare judicial decisions (e.g. AMS 00224789620014025101 of 2009).</p>

                  <title>Business profits</title>
                  <p>Profits of permanent establishments (such as branches, representation offices and agencies), as well as undistributed profits from affiliated and controlled entities abroad, are converted into Brazilian real and added to the results of the Brazilian legal entity on 31 December of every year, regardless of effective distribution, under the provisions of Brazilian CFC rules.</p>
                  <p>After constant discussions on the validity and constitutionality of the Brazilian CFC rules, and subsequent to the decision issued by the Supreme Court on the matter (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.4.">10.4.</xref>), Law 12,973/2014 introduced the new Brazilian CFC regulations. Amongst other changes, a distinction is made on the taxation of controlled companies and affiliate companies – the latter is only subject to the automatic taxation under certain circumstances.</p>
                  <p>The law is generally effective as of 1 January 2015. However, taxpayers could elect to implement the new CFC rules and other regulations for the calendar year 2014. For details on CFC rules, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.4.">10.4.</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Provided that the jurisdiction in which the permanent establishment, affiliated or controlled company is located, has financial and accounting standards for the preparation of financial statements, the profits will be recognized in Brazil, considering such standards (i.e. there is no recalculation according to domestic rules). A tax credit equivalent to the income tax paid abroad on the same profits is usually granted.</p>
                  <p>The offsetting of losses incurred in the foreign jurisdiction against the profits derived in Brazil is not allowed.</p>
                  <p>Remittances for the capitalization of the permanent establishment abroad is considered an investment and thus not subject to withholding income tax.</p>
                  <p>Payments to the permanent establishment abroad are considered transactions between related parties under Brazilian legislation (article 23 of Law 9,430/1996). Therefore, deductions are subject to transfer pricing rules (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.2.">10.2.</xref>). Deductions of payments of interest made by the Brazilian legal entity to its permanent establishment abroad are subject to thin capitalization rules (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.3.">10.3.</xref>).</p>

               <title>Double taxation relief</title>
               <p>Legislation concerning double taxation relief includes article 465 of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_rir">RIR</xref>, Law 9,249/1995, Law 9,430/1996 and Normative Instruction 213/2002, while Law 12,973/2014 and Normative Instruction 1,520/2014 contain double taxation relief applicable under CFC rules. </p>
               <p>Brazil taxes not only foreign-source income derived by resident companies (whether directly or through a branch), but also the income derived by foreign controlled or affiliated companies in proportion to the ownership percentage held by the Brazilian parent. Unilateral relief is granted to corporate taxpayers by means of an ordinary foreign tax credit system. Relief granted under tax treaties is applicable regardless of whether the relief is foreseen in domestic law (e.g. Divergence Ruling 8/2014).</p>
               <p>Taxes paid abroad on income directly derived by a Brazilian-resident taxpayer may be claimed as a credit against the domestic tax liability. This foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of domestic tax that is imposed on the foreign-source income. For these purposes, the Brazilian tax liability includes both <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_irpj">IRPJ</xref> and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_csll">CSLL</xref> – <emph type="i">see</emph> the Introduction. Excess credit may be carried forward indefinitely.</p>
               <p>Brazilian tax authorities hold the position that resident entities opting for the presumed profit regime of taxation (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.2.1.">1.2.1.</xref>) and directly providing services abroad are not allowed to offset taxes paid abroad with taxes paid in Brazil (Divergence Ruling 8/2014). However, this prohibition does not apply if the service is provided within countries with which Brazil has signed a tax treaty where the elimination of international double taxation is agreed through the use of the credit method, without restrictions connected to the regimes of taxation opted by the taxpayer in Brazil. This is also understood as a confirmation that Brazil allows the granting of credit based on tax treaties only (that is, regardless of whether it is foreseen under domestic law).</p>
               <p>Under CFC rules (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.4.">10.4.</xref>), an ordinary foreign tax credit is available for the tax on profit distributions by foreign subsidiaries and for the underlying tax paid by the distributing subsidiary in the jurisdiction where the foreign entity is located. As a general rule, the foreign tax credit must be calculated separately for each company, with no consolidation allowed for different subsidiaries (i.e. a per-company limitation).</p>
               <p>However, Law 12,973/2014 introduced a temporary possibility (until 2022) for consolidating the results derived by controlled subsidiaries with “active income”, provided that certain conditions are met (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_7.2.2.">7.2.2.</xref>). In case the results of the controlled companies are consolidated, the foreign tax to be considered is the one related to the taxes paid by the entities which results have been consolidated.</p>
               <p>According to Law 12,973/2014, until 2022 Brazilian entities with foreign controlled companies acting in certain business sectors are entitled to a fictitious credit of 9% to be offset against the tax due on the profits of such foreign subsidiaries, provided that certain conditions are met (for details, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.4.">10.4.</xref>).</p>
               <p>With regard to foreign branches, the foreign tax credit is subject to a per-country limitation, i.e. the taxes paid by the branch may be consolidated with the taxes paid by other branches located in the same jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>For purposes of computing the credit, a qualifying foreign tax is a tax levied on profits and which is paid by the non-resident subsidiary or branch, irrespective of the type of tax imposed by the country concerned.</p>
               <p>The credit allowed in a fiscal year may not exceed the amount of tax attributable to the foreign income computed by applying the Brazilian <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> rate to the foreign taxable income.</p>
               <p>The amount is converted into BRL according to the exchange rate on the day on which the income is recognized on the books of the Brazilian company.</p>
               <p>The document attesting the payment of the tax abroad must be certified by tax authorities of the jurisdiction in which the tax was paid and by the Brazilian Embassy in the relevant country. However, as clarified in Private Ruling 155/2018, the certification is not necessary if the taxpayer demonstrates that, pursuant to the legislation of the other country, the document itself is sufficient proof of payment of the foreign tax.</p>

               <p>On 1 July 2021 and 8 October 2021, Brazil signed joint-statements with other Inclusive Framework members with an agreement to implement a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. The solution includes a plan to re-allocate part of taxing rights over large and highly profitable enterprises from their home countries to jurisdictions in which goods or services are supplied or consumers are located (market jurisdictions), regardless of whether these enterprises have a physical presence there (Pillar One). This new taxing right for market jurisdictions (the so-called Amount A) would affect multinational groups with a global turnover above EUR 20 billion and profit before tax above 10%. A multilateral convention for implementation of Pillar One and with the requirement to remove all digital service taxes and other relevant similar measures (as well as not to introduce such measures in the future) is expected to be signed (<emph type="i">see also</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.5.">14.6.4.5.</xref>).</p>

               <title>Withholding taxes</title>
               <p>Generally, a non-resident entity without a permanent establishment is subject to final withholding income tax. Rates vary depending on the type of income.</p>
               <p>Where no special rate is provided, a general final withholding tax rate of 15% on the gross amount applies. In general, payments made to entities residing in low-tax jurisdictions under Brazilian law are subject to withholding income tax at a 25% rate, unless specific rules apply. Resident companies are required to withhold income tax at the maturity date of the debt or at the remittance of the values abroad, whichever occurs first (and not upon recognition of the debt in the accounting records), as confirmed in Appeal Case 1,864,227 at the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
               <p>Law 9,481/1997 lists certain payments made to non-resident persons which are subject to a 0% withholding tax rate. The list includes commissions paid by exporters to agents located abroad and certain interest payments (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_7.3.4.2.">7.3.4.2.</xref>).

                  <p>Royalty payments to non-resident entities are subject to a final withholding tax at the rate of 15% on the gross amount (article 767 of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_rir">RIR</xref>). Royalties paid by resident entities to non-residents as consideration for the transfer of technology, trademarks and patents, and for the supply of technical, administrative or scientific assistance, are also subject to the contribution for intervention in the economic domain (<xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cide">CIDE</xref>) – <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.4.">14.6.4.4.</xref> This contribution is not subject to any withholding mechanism; rather, it is imposed directly on the Brazilian payer. The CIDE contribution is not imposed on cross-border payments of software licence fees, except for payments involving the acquisition of software rights (transfer of technology).</p>
                  <p>The payment of royalties does not trigger the payment of <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_icms">ICMS</xref> or <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref> (Brazilian federal and state VATs). Divergence Ruling 18/2017, published in the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_dou">DOU</xref> of 5 April 2017, determined that outbound payments made by importers for rights over the sale or distribution of software to final consumers in Brazil, who are granted a licence for the use of software, are considered royalties and are thus subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15%. This Divergence Ruling changed the initial understanding of the tax authorities (as expressed in Divergence Ruling 27/2008) that such payments are considered payment for the purchase of goods and therefore only subject to ICMS.</p>
                  <p>If the beneficiary of the royalties is located in a low-tax jurisdiction (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.6.">10.6.</xref>), the withholding income tax rate is 25%.</p>
                  <p>Declaratory Interpretative Act 7/17, published in the DOU of 26 December 2017 consolidated the position of the tax authorities on the payments made by Brazilian parties to foreign beneficiaries in consideration for the right to distribute and/or to commercialize software. Accordingly, such payments qualify under Brazilian tax legislation as royalties and are thus subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (25% if the beneficiary is resident in a low-tax jurisdiction).</p>
                  <p>Brazilian tax treaties normally provide that the treatment of technical services and technical assistance fees follows the treatment of royalties.

These payments are qualified as outbound payments for technical services (the rate is increased to 25% in the case of payments to persons located in low-tax jurisdictions) and not as outbound payments for educational or scientific purposes, which are exempt.</p>
                     <p>Private Ruling 153/2017, published in the DOU of 22 March 2017, explained that the taxable event triggering withholding tax in the case of payments of service fees to non-resident persons through “income crediting” (<emph type="i">crédito de rendimento</emph>) occurs upon the recognition of the payment obligation in the accounting records of the paying source in Brazil, provided that the economic or juridical availability of the income is characterized. </p>

Law 13,202/2015 clarified the matter by setting forth that, for the purpose of interpretation, tax treaties signed by Brazil also apply to CSLL.

                     <p>In the most recent treaties concluded by Brazil an article stipulating that the provisions of the convention do not prevent a contracting state from applying the provisions of its tax law regarding thin capitalization and controlled foreign corporations is normally included. Some treaties also provide additional rules regarding the limitation of benefits deriving from the DTT for parties that do not reside in the contracting states.</p>

                     <title>Tax sparing credit</title>
                     <p>The effect of tax exemptions granted by some countries to non-resident investors is not intended to be nullified by levies in the investor’s country of residence. To that effect, certain tax treaties of Brazil contain provisions granting a fixed foreign tax credit in the country of residence on certain categories of foreign income paid by a Brazilian source, even if such income is exempt from withholding income tax in Brazil or subject to a low level of taxation under Brazilian law.</p>
                     <p>Tax-sparing credit is generally provided under tax treaties mainly with regard to interest and royalties arising in Brazil and paid to a resident of the other contracting state. In general, considering that the domestic rates are currently lower than those provided under the treaties, the sparing credit in the jurisdiction of the beneficiary is higher than the withholding income tax paid in Brazil upon the remittance of interest and royalties.</p>

                     <p>Brazilian tax treaties contain no provisions dealing with excluded individuals. The treaties apply to residents of the contracting states and, as a rule, Brazilian tax treaties contain the standard wording of article 4 of the OECD Model.</p>

                     <title>Other special provisions</title>
                     <p>Brazilian tax treaties normally provide that other income, income not dealt with specifically in other provisions of the tax treaties, may be taxed at source.</p>
                     <p>Brazilian tax authorities have historically adopted a restrictive approach regarding the application and interpretation of tax treaties, avoiding or reducing the limitations on Brazilian taxing rights. This position has been highly criticized by the Brazilian legal community and has also raised some concerns from other contracting states with regard to tax treaties concluded with Brazil.</p>
                     <p>The treaty article that raises the majority of the discussions is article 7 (Business Profits), which generally follows the wording contained in the OECD Model. The Brazilian tax authorities adopt a very restrictive approach in order to deny the application of this treaty provision, which would generally result in the application of withholding taxes on remittances for technical services and technical assistance. </p>
                     <p>In this respect, Brazil used to apply withholding tax on payments for technical services and assistance not involving the transfer of technology, even when a tax treaty applied, on the basis of Ruling 01/2000. Tax authorities argued that the payment of such income could not be classified as business profit (article 7) but rather as gross income (i.e. before deductions) under Brazilian domestic legislation. Therefore, article 21 of tax treaties signed by Brazil would apply (article 21 in treaties signed by Brazil normally does not follow the OECD Model and grants taxing rights to both the source country and the residence country). This issue has been taken to federal courts and there are decisions supporting both positions. In 2012, the case <emph type="i">Copesul</emph> reached the Superior Court of Justice, where a unanimous decision was given in favour of the application of the business profit article in the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_br-ca_01_eng_1984_tt">Brazil-Canada Income Tax Treaty (1984)</extxref> and in the (currently terminated) Brazil-Germany Income and Capital Tax Treaty (1975).</p>
                     <p>Brazil’s National Treasury Attorney’s Office (PGFN) then issued a significant opinion (PGFN/CAT 2,363/2013), in which it revisited the tax authorities’ long-standing position on the interpretation of the business profits article in tax treaties signed by Brazil in this respect. PGFN expressed its opinion in favour of the application of the business profit article to payments for the provision of technical service and technical assistance without the transfer of technology. On the other hand, the PGFN also suggested that the royalties article is applicable in case of treaties where technical services and technical assistance is covered by this article – most treaties signed with Brazil include “technical services and technical assistance” within the scope of the royalties article (generally by the protocol of treaties).</p>
                     <p>As a result, on 20 June 2014, tax authorities issued Ruling 05/2014, which revoked Ruling 01/2000, to determine that the provision of technical services and technical assistance (with or without the transfer of technology) is subject to:</p>

                        <item label="-">

                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>As a result of the position of the tax authorities, private rulings have been issued confirming (or rejecting) the application of withholding taxes and the qualification of the income under several treaties. For example, on 1 July 2015, Private Letter Ruling 153/2015 was issued in regard to the interpretation and application of the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_br-fr_01_eng_1971_tt">Brazil-France Income Tax Treaty (1971)</extxref>. Accordingly, income paid by Brazilian sources to individual or legal entities resident in France in consideration for technical services or technical assistance, with or without transfer of technology, falls under the business article and therefore is not subject to withholding tax in Brazil. The application of the business article in this case is due to the fact that this treaty neither characterizes payments in consideration for technical services or technical assistance as royalties nor do the services provided in the specific case of the ruling fall within the scope of the provision on independent professional services and independent workers. On 26 May 2020, the Superior Court of Justice confirmed the application of the business profit to the payments made to a service provider resident in France, in the absence of a permanent establishment in Brazil (Special Appeal 1618897).</p>
                     <p>The same understanding was given by Private Ruling 65/2018, published in the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_dou">DOU</xref> of 28 May 2018, in respect of payments for technical services or technical assistance under the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_br-se_01_eng_1975_tt">Brazil-Sweden Income Tax Treaty (1975)</extxref>. Private Ruling 155/2016 (<emph type="i">Solução de Consulta</emph> 155/2016), published in the DOU of 30 November 2016, and Private Ruling 5/2017 (<emph type="i">Solução de Consulta</emph> 5/2017), published in the DOU of 18 January 2016, confirmed that income paid by Brazilian sources to individual or legal entities resident in Argentina and Canada for technical services or technical assistance, with or without transfer of technology, is subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15% in Brazil according to the protocol of treaties signed with those countries. On 5 December 2018, Private Ruling 2017/2018 clarified that outbound payments for technical services or technical assistance provided by companies resident in Finland are not subject to withholding taxes in Brazil according to the <extxref publish="n" target="tt_br-fi_01_eng_1996_tt">Brazil-Finland Income Tax Treaty (1996)</extxref>. This understanding has been confirmed in Private Rulings 6017/2019 and 99,006/2020.</p>
                     <p>In July 2020, the Regional Federal Court of the 3rd Region decided that withholding tax applies to outbound payments for the provision of technical services and assistance under the Brazil-Germany tax treaty (no longer effective), the Brazil-Spain tax treaty and the Brazil-Argentina tax treaty (cases 0024442-10.2001.4.03.6100, 5023086-93.2018.4.03.6100 and 0004819-10.2014.4.03.6130, respectively).</p>

            <title>General anti-avoidance rules</title>
            <p>In 2001, general anti-avoidance rules were introduced for both domestic and international transactions (article 116 of the National Tax Code). Tax authorities may disregard transactions carried out with the purpose of hiding taxable events or of modifying the tax liability. The general anti-avoidance rule requires further regulation by an ordinary law to set conditions, criteria and procedures to be followed by tax authorities. Such regulation has not yet been enacted, which triggered discussions regarding the limits of what is considered legal in tax planning and the need for a case-by-case analysis by the tax authorities.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, although there are no statutory provisions currently applicable authorizing tax authorities to disregard transactions, such approach has been repeatedly adopted mainly on the basis of the concept of simulation existing in article 167 of the Civil Code and in article 149 (7) of the National Tax Code. Indeed, there is a current trend of Brazilian tax authorities and the tax courts to disregard structures lacking economic substance and business purpose (e.g. administrative decisions 9101-002.429, 1201-001.640/2017 and 9101-002.392/2016, issued by the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_csrf">CSRF</xref>).</p>
            <p>On 20 April 2022, the Federal Supreme Court ruled that the general anti-avoidance rule in article 116 of the National Tax Code is constitutional but may only apply in the case of sham or fraud and cannot be applied to disregard businesses legitimately carried out by taxpayers. The power to disregard acts or business transactions provided by this article is thus limited to legal acts or transactions carried out with the intention of dissimulating or concealing a tax-triggering event.</p>
            <p>Specific anti-avoidance rules apply under Brazilian legislation, i.e. special tax treatment for outbound payments to residents in low-tax jurisdictions, transfer pricing, thin capitalization and CFC rules.</p>

               <title>Special tax treatment for outbound payments to residents in low-tax jurisdictions</title>
               <p>Payments of certain types of income (e.g. interest and royalties), as well as capital gains earned by entities resident in low-tax jurisdictions, are generally subject to withholding tax at the rate of 25%. Also, certain tax benefits, which are generally available to non-residents of Brazil, are not granted to parties located in low-tax jurisdictions.</p>

               <title>Statutory framework</title>
               <p>The transfer pricing rules adopted by Brazil in 1996 – with new rules introduced by Law 12,715/2012 – deviate from the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. Despite generally following the methodology suggested by the OECD Guidelines, Brazilian law adopted fixed margins for the various methods, regardless of the specific situation of the taxpayer or peculiarities of the business. The criteria for searching for and adopting comparables are not clearly regulated. The transfer pricing rules expressly authorize only two comparability factors: specific contractual terms and some differences in characteristics of similar products, services or rights. In addition, there is not much leeway for advance pricing agreement (APA) procedures. The related-party test covers various relationships and is not restricted to associated enterprises.</p>
               <p>Transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between related parties. However, transactions between a Brazilian resident and a company resident in a low-tax jurisdiction or benefiting from a privileged tax regime (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.6.1.">10.6.1.</xref>) are subject to Brazilian transfer pricing rules, irrespective of whether the two parties qualify as associated enterprises.</p>
               <p>Brazilian transfer pricing rules currently do not apply to cross-border payments of trademark or patent royalties, nor to fees payable as compensation for the transfer of technology or for the rendering of technical, administrative or scientific assistance services. Such transactions should be registered with the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_inpi">INPI</xref> and the Brazilian Central Bank.</p>
               <p>Under Normative Instruction 1,312/2012, Brazilian transfer pricing rules also apply to intercompany back-to-back transactions, even if the goods or services do not enter or leave the country, that is, even if there is no effective import or export transaction, but the transaction is carried out by a Brazilian company and a foreign affiliated company. </p>

                  <title>Future changes to Brazilian transfer pricing system</title>
                  <p>On 28 February 2018, the OECD and Brazil launched a joint project examining the similarities and gaps between the Brazilian and OECD approaches to valuing cross-border transactions between associated firms for tax purposes. The project also assesses the potential for Brazil to move closer to the OECD’s transfer pricing rules. The alignment of Brazilian transfer pricing rules with the OECD policy is considered an important step for any future process of accession to the organization, as on 29 May 2017 Brazil presented an official request for initiating a process to join the OECD.</p>
                  <p>On 11 July 2019, a joint statement by the OECD and Brazil on the transfer pricing project was issued. The assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of existing transfer pricing rules and administrative practices:</p>

                     <item label="-">
                        <p>revealed that (i) a large number of the gaps or issues identified lead to instances of double taxation and create BEPS risks, leading to potential loss of revenue; (ii) significant international tax uncertainty results from the misalignment of rules; and (iii) despite unintended negative consequences, the Brazilian system is characterized by its ability to bring simplicity and practicability to the process of performing a transfer pricing analysis, such as the possibility of overcoming challenges related to the lack of comparables and profitability levels, predictability and domestic certainty, requirement of only limited administrative and financial resources, and involvement of reduced costs and time – all of these leading to the ease of tax administration and tax compliance.</p>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Two options for greater alignment with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines were explored and developed in the key final deliverable of the project. The first option seeks to immediately align Brazilian transfer pricing rules with the OECD Guidelines. The second option discusses the same process, but structured into stages of gradual implementation over a longer period of time. According to the joint statement, the most appropriate approach for a gradual alignment would be “to set the conditions for a progressive transition of bringing taxpayers into the new system in the short term, which could for instance be based on a specific threshold and initially concern the largest taxpayers operating in Brazil, and, thereafter, by lowering the threshold based on an analysis of the population of taxpayers, as many times as deemed necessary (in the longer term)”. Both options consider how to maintain a number of elements of simplification, which provide ease of tax administration, ease of tax compliance and tax certainty (i.e. the fixed margins approach – for example, in the form of carefully tailored safe harbours or rebuttable presumptions).</p>
                  <p>The joint statement also concluded that the time is ripe to make political decisions regarding whether to align and how this alignment should be carried out, and that the specific implementation needs of Brazil will be important in considering the way forward. With the objective of aiding this process of political decision-making and planning of the possible implementation, a blueprint or implementation roadmap is to be developed, outlining the key areas to be addressed.</p>
                  <p>On 18 December 2019, a joint report was issued with proposals for a “full and immediate alignment” (i.e. immediately aligning the Brazilian transfer pricing rules with the OECD standard, including the arm's length principle and the guidance for its application contained in the OECD Guidelines and other relevant guidance, and making the new rules and regulations applicable to all taxpayers immediately) and for a “full and gradual alignment” (involving the same process, but structured in stages so as to allow for the gradual implementation of the new and/or amended provisions over a longer period of time) of the Brazilian transfer pricing rules with the OECD standard. A partial alignment was also considered, but eventually dismissed by the report as a viable option. Partial alignment would imply that significant gaps remain in the system, which may have negative effects on tax certainty and the compliance burden, as well as carrying risks of persistent double taxation and loss of tax revenue.</p>
                  <p>On 30 July 2020, the OECD and the Brazilian tax authorities launched a survey for taxpayers with business interest in Brazil as well as other stakeholders to give input regarding the development of safe harbours as well as other simplification measures that can contribute to enhanced tax certainty. The survey included questions on the identification of situations where specific safe-harbour regimes may be needed and the use of the available comparables and of APAs.</p>
                  <p>On 12 April 2022, the tax authorities and the OECD presented the main features of a new transfer pricing system for Brazil. The new system will be composed of rules addressing the general principles that apply to transfer pricing, which would be in line with the OECD standards. In addition, it will provide rules on specific types of transactions (e.g. intangibles, financial transactions) and on certain topics that are relevant from a transfer pricing perspective (e.g. royalties).</p>

               <p>Law 9,430/96 provides that the average costs and prices must be ascertained through (i) official publications and reports issued by the government of the buyer or the seller, (ii) a statement from the tax authorities of such countries, in cases where Brazil has an exchange of information agreement with the other country and (iii) research by companies or organizations of undeniable technical knowledge or technical publications, which specify the sector, the period, the companies analysed and the margin determined, as well as identifying – per company – the collected data. These reports and research will be accepted as evidence only if, in the course of their preparation, international evaluation methods were respected and the reports and research refer to a time contemporaneous to that of the relevant income tax liability.</p>
               <p>Documents presented by the taxpayer may be disqualified by an official order of the Federal Revenue Service if they are deemed to be inadequate or inconsistent.</p>
               <p>Under article 43 of Normative Ruling 1,312/12, the only documents that are deemed adequate to serve as proof are price publications resulting from researches conducted under the responsibility of international organizations such as the World Trade Organization or the OECD. However, publications may be disqualified by the Secretary of Revenue if they are deemed to be inconsistent or untrue.</p>
               <p>Brazilian law adopts absolute and relative assumptions, which is to say that, whenever transactions occur among associated entities, the taxpayer must prove through one of the predetermined methods that the agreed consideration respected the arm’s length principle.</p>
               <p>Brazilian law does not specify the documents required from taxpayers. It is merely necessary that the taxpayer provide the necessary documentation to prove that the agreed consideration in the transaction is in line with the arm’s length principle. From a practical perspective, taxpayers usually provide sales agreements, invoices, income tax returns and spreadsheets as supporting documentation. Any documentation in a foreign language must be translated into Portuguese by a sworn translator.</p>
               <p>There are no specific transfer pricing-related penalty charges in Brazil. There are, however, general penalties for underpayment of corporate income tax (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_1.11.5.">1.11.5.</xref>). Therefore, upon a tax audit, if the tax authorities take the position that a transfer pricing adjustment was not calculated correctly and, therefore, there was an underpayment of corporate income tax, the above penalties and interest will be applicable to such tax difference.</p>

                  <title>CbC reporting</title>
                  <p>Normative Instruction 1,681/2016 provided for the CbC reporting obligation for any final holding company of multinational groups that is resident for tax purposes in Brazil and whose economic group has earned consolidated revenues higher than BRL 2.26 billion or EUR 750 million in the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year of the report.</p>
                  <p>Through the CbC reporting, the Brazilian Revenue Service will have access to information aggregated by each jurisdiction in which the multinational group operates, comprising the following items: (i) consolidated revenues, segregating those obtained in transactions with related and unrelated parties; (ii) income or losses before income tax; (iii) income tax and, in the case of Brazil, also the amount of <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_csll">CSLL</xref> paid; (iv) the income tax outstanding; (v) the capital stock; (vi) retained earnings; (vii) the number of employees, workers and other associates; and (viii) tangible assets different than cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the reporting entity shall identify: (i) each entity that is a member of the multinational group and its jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes; (ii) the place of incorporation (only when the tax residence does not correspond to the place of incorporation); and (iii) the nature of its main economic activities.</p>
                  <p>Multinational companies that are obliged to fill in the CbC report must provide information from the economic group to the Brazilian Revenue Service, which will exchange this information with the other countries under the joined the MCAA (2016) on the automatic exchange of CbC reports (signed on 21 October 2016). On 20 July 2017, Brazil and the United States also concluded a bilateral Competent Authority Agreement for the exchange of CbC reports. On 27 November 2018, the tax authorities initiated the exchange of CbC reports with other jurisdictions.</p>

               <title>Transfer pricing methods and practice</title>
               <p>Although based on the OECD Guidelines, as expressly recognized by the reasoning (<emph type="i">Exposição de Motivos</emph>) of Law 9,430/2000, as presented by the Brazilian Congress, the Brazilian transfer pricing rules deviate from the OECD Guidelines in several aspects. Despite generally following the methodology suggested by the OECD Guidelines, Brazilian law adopted fixed margins for the various methods, regardless of the specific situation of the taxpayer or peculiarities of the business (i.e. no functional analysis is provided for under Brazilian transfer pricing rules). The criteria for searching for and adopting comparables are not clearly regulated. The transfer pricing rules expressly authorize only two adjustments to allow the comparability of transactions: specific contractual terms and some differences in characteristics of similar products, services or rights. In addition, there are no APA procedures. The related-party test covers several relationships and is not restricted to associated enterprises. On 28 February 2018, the OECD and Brazil launched a joint project to assess the potential for Brazil to move closer to the OECD’s transfer pricing rules – for details, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.2.1.">10.2.1.</xref>
               </p>
               <p>From a litigation perspective, Brazilian tax authorities started focusing on this issue and some assessments were brought against taxpayers in recent years. Litigation precedents have not yet been consolidated to address firm guidance that can be simply adopted by companies searching for an ideal transfer pricing methodology in Brazil.</p>
               <p>Brazilian transfer pricing methods vary, depending on the type of transactions, i.e. import or export. For example, a resident entity receiving royalty payments from abroad is considered to have performed an export.</p>

                  <p>Under Brazilian transfer pricing rules, there are currently four methods for determining the price limit for products, services or rights imported by Brazilian companies from related parties:</p>

                        <p>Comparable uncontrolled price: based on the average price of identical or similar products or services applied in purchase and sale transactions carried out in either the internal or external market under similar payment conditions. Under Law 12,715/2012, as of January 2013, if the comparable is based on transactions performed by the taxpayer himself, those operations must represent at least 5% of the total amount of import transactions carried out with related parties in the same tax year. If the transactions in that given year do not reach the 5% threshold, the taxpayer may also consider the transactions performed in the previous year, adjusted by currency fluctuations.</p>

                  <p>Brazilian law adopts some safe harbour rules for transfer pricing of export transactions. Under the first general safe harbour rule, which is expressly provided by the law, a taxpayer is deemed to have applied an appropriate transfer price when the average export sales price is at least 90% of the average domestic sales in the Brazilian market during the same period and under similar payment terms. A second safe harbour allows, as a general rule, a difference of up to 5% between the actual price and the comparable price. In the case of commodities, a difference of up to 3% is accepted between the parameter price obtained through the use of PCI (price under import quotation) and PCEX (price under export quotation) methods and the tested price.</p>
                  <p>Two other safe harbours aim at simplifying the application of the transfer pricing rules (these two other safe harbours are not considered true safe harbours because the tax authorities remain required to observe the transfer pricing methods and may, in theory, assess the taxpayers). The first establishes that if the exporter is able to prove that the net commercial profit derived from the export transaction is equal to at least 10% of the export income, based on the annual averages of the calendar year and the two last taxable periods, and provided that the net export revenue to related entities does not exceed 20% of the total net export revenue, the exporter may prove the appropriateness of its transfer pricing exclusively based on the export transaction documents. The other safe harbour rule provides that if the exporter is able to prove that the net export income does not exceed 5% of the total net income in the same calendar year, the exporter may prove the appropriateness of its transfer pricing exclusively based on the export transaction documents. Both safe harbour rules are not applicable to the transactions subject to the quote price for exports method.</p>
                  <p>If more than one method applies, the company may adopt the one resulting in the lower export price. If the average price applied by the Brazilian company in its export transactions exceeds the average price obtained under the above-mentioned methods, no adjustment is required. Conversely, if the average price applied by the Brazilian company is lower than the price obtained under the above-mentioned methods, a transfer pricing adjustment is required and, thus, the existing difference will be added to the taxable base.</p>
                  <p>On 24 September 2008, the Brazilian Revenue Service issued Administrative Rule 222 (<emph type="i">Portaria</emph> 222), by means of which new regulations were issued for Brazilian corporate taxpayers willing to claim changes on the predetermined profit margins provided for by the Brazilian transfer pricing methods, as reviewed above. Under these regulations, the claim can be made by a corporate taxpayer individually or by a trade union/business class association. The claim must be supported by several documents established by the mentioned rule. No request can be presented for past taxable periods. There are no public cases in which a change of margins was accepted by tax authorities.</p>

                     <p>In relation to outbound loans, taxpayers are required to recognize for CIT purposes a minimum interest revenue based on the same parameters outlined above, i.e. LIBOR for USD deposits with a 3% annual spread for agreements executed up to 31 December 2012 and different rates, depending on the characteristics of the transaction, for agreements executed as of 1 January 2013.</p>
                     <p>Ordinance 427/2013 defined that, when determining the minimum revenue amount to be recognized, the annual spread shall be 2.5%.</p>
                     <p>Finally, Brazilian transfer pricing rules currently do not apply to cross-border payments of trademark or patent royalties, nor to fees payable as compensation for the transfer of technology or for the rendering of technical, administrative or scientific assistance services, which are subject to specific deductibility limits and requirements.</p>
                     <p>Transactions between a Brazilian company and a company resident in a low-tax jurisdiction or benefiting from a privileged tax regime (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.6.">10.6.</xref>) are subject to Brazilian transfer pricing rules, irrespective of whether the two parties qualify as related parties.</p>

               <p>Brazilian thin capitalization rules are set forth by Law 12,249/2010, under articles 24 and 25. Accordingly, deductibility restrictions for <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cit">CIT</xref> purposes apply with regard to interest payments made in connection with (i) loans granted by related persons (article 24) and (ii) loans granted by (related or unrelated) persons located in low-tax jurisdictions or benefiting from privileged tax regimes, as classified under Brazilian tax law (article 25).</p>
               <p>Under Brazilian thin capitalization rules, interest paid by a Brazilian company to a foreign related party (individual or legal entity) who is neither located in low-tax jurisdiction nor benefiting from a privileged tax regime may be deducted for CIT purposes only if the interest expense is necessary for the company’s activities and the following thresholds are cumulatively met (article 250 of Decree 9,580/2018 and article 24 of Law 12,249/2010):</p>

            </taxtopics>
            <title>Controlled foreign company</title>
            <p>Under the current Brazilian CFC rules, in force as of 1 January 2015 (as introduced by Law 12,973/2014 and regulated by Normative Instruction 1,520/2014), profits of (directly and indirectly) controlled foreign companies (and of foreign permanent establishments) are converted into BRL and added to the results of the Brazilian legal parent for tax purposes (corporate income tax and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_csll">CSLL</xref>) in proportion to the ownership percentage, regardless of actual distribution, irrespective of the jurisdiction in which the controlled foreign company is located and irrespective of whether profits arose from active or passive activities. Profits of affiliated companies abroad may be also added to the results of the Brazilian entity if certain requirements are not met (<emph type="i">see</emph> details of both regimes further below).</p>
            <p>Law 12,973/2014 does not refer to the taxation of the “profit” of the controlled foreign companies, but to the taxation of the “variation of the investment value equivalent to the profit” of the controlled foreign companies (although in practice they are the same) as a way to support the interpretation in the sense that there is no taxation at the level of the foreign company but at the level of the Brazilian company (and thus prevent the argument of unconstitutionality or incompatibility of the CFC rule with article 7 of tax treaties).</p>
            <p>On 22 January 2020, the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_carf">CARF</xref> judged the <emph type="i">Votorantim</emph> case (decision 1302-004.272), in which it was held that the Brazilian tax authorities cannot make tax adjustments in the profits of the CFC for the purpose of determining the taxable profit in Brazil. In this case, the tax authorities disallowed the deduction of financial expenses recognized by the company domiciled in Austria upon the issuance of “jouissance rights”, which resulted in an increase in the profit to be taxed in Brazil under the CFC regime.</p>
            <p>According to the decision, the tax authorities cannot make tax adjustments in the results obtained by the legal entity abroad, since the tax legislation establishes that the profit earned abroad that is to be subject to taxation in Brazil under the CFC regime must be calculated in accordance with the accounting rules in force in the foreign country where the affiliated or controlled company is located.</p>
            <p>Before 1 January 2015, Brazilian CFC rules did not provide for different tax treatments for controlled and affiliated foreign companies. According to the previous rules, profits of both types of subsidiaries were included in the results of the Brazilian entity, regardless of actual distribution and of whether these profits arose from active or passive activities and of the jurisdiction in which the controlled or affiliated company was located. </p>
            <p>On 10 April 2013, the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_stf">STF</xref> ruled that the old Brazilian CFC rules were unconstitutional in regard to foreign affiliated companies located outside a low-tax jurisdiction. The court confirmed, however, the constitutionality of the old Brazilian CFC rules in regard of foreign controlled companies located in low-tax jurisdictions. The decision, given in the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality 2,588, was binding on all taxpayers. According to the decision, the old Brazilian CFC rules could no longer apply to foreign affiliated companies located outside a low-tax jurisdiction. The rules remained applicable to foreign affiliated companies located in a low-tax jurisdiction and to foreign controlled companies located outside a low-tax jurisdiction, since the court did not reach a decision on the constitutionality of the old Brazilian CFC rules in those cases (<emph type="i">see</emph> BR: SFC, 10 Apr. 2013, 2,588, Case Law IBFD).</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, in the judgment of Extraordinary Appeal 541,090 on the same day, the Supreme Federal Court confirmed the constitutionality of Brazilian CFC rules in regard of foreign controlled companies located outside a low-tax jurisdiction. The decision is not binding on all taxpayers, but establishes case law on the matter (<emph type="i">see</emph> BR: SFC, 10 Apr. 2013, 2,588, Case Law IBFD).</p>
            <p>In view of the STF decision, Brazil amended its CFC rules, which led to the current CFC regimes applicable as of 1 January 2015 and explained below.</p>
            <topic anchor="cta_br_2022-07-01_top_31">
               <title>Regimes for controlled and affiliated foreign companies</title>
               <p>A controlled foreign company is one in which the investor holds, directly or via related parties, rights that assure, on a permanent basis, the power to elect the majority of the directors and to prevail in corporate decisions. An affiliated company is one in which the investor has significant influence, considered as the power to take part in the definition of the company’s financial and operating policy, however, without holding control over the company. A presumed significant influence occurs whenever the investor holds 20% or more of the shareholding interest of the company, without holding control. Brazilian parent companies of affiliated companies abroad are, however, deemed to be controlling parent company for the purpose of CFC rules in the case this company holds, together with other related persons (resident or non-resident in Brazil) more than 50% of the affiliated company’s capital.</p>
               <p>The new CFC rules regarding controlled companies have not changed significantly from the old regime. Accordingly, profits derived by all controlled foreign companies of Brazilian entities continue to be subject to automatic taxation in Brazil (in proportion to their participation), irrespective of the jurisdiction in which the controlled company is located, and regardless of whether or not the profits are legally or economically available to the Brazilian entity and of whether they arose from active or passive activities. An ordinary foreign tax credit is available for foreign taxes levied on profit distributions, if any, and an indirect credit has been introduced for the underlying corporate tax paid by the subsidiary (or permanent establishment) abroad. The indirect credit is allowed (in proportion to the Brazilian entity’s participation) in respect of corporate income tax paid by the foreign controlled entity (or foreign permanent establishment) on the positive results recognized and taxed in Brazil under CFC rules. This amount must be converted into BRL based on the exchange rate determined by the Brazilian Central Bank (if the foreign currency has no quotation, the amount is converted into USD and subsequently to BRL). </p>
               <p>The payment of tax abroad must be evidenced by means of an official document issued by the foreign tax authority and validated by the Brazilian consulate/embassy in the foreign country. The amount of the indirect credit is limited to the amount of corporate income tax and CSLL due in Brazil on such results. Excess credit may be carried forward indefinitely.</p>
               <p>Losses of directly and indirectly foreign controlled companies cannot be offset against the profits of the parent company in Brazil. Such losses can only be offset against profits generated by the foreign controlled or affiliated company on an entity-by-entity basis: the positive results of each entity are calculated individually and added to the results of the Brazilian company while the losses of each entity may be offset against the positive results of each entity only (for details on the offsetting of foreign losses under CFC rules, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_7.2.2.">7.2.2.</xref>) (article 79 of Law 12,973/2014). This tax treatment was highly debatable. However, the STJ, in the trial of Special Appeal 1.161.003-RS (the <emph type="i">Marcopolo</emph> case), held that losses of foreign controlled and affiliated companies may only be offset against profits generated by the same company abroad. However, a consolidation of the results is possible until 2022 and under certain circumstances (<emph type="i">see</emph> details below under Consolidation for controlled subsidiaries with active income).</p>
               <p>Law 12,973/2014 modified, however, the technique to include such profits of a foreign subsidiary on a current basis by requiring the Brazilian parent to revalue its investments annually such that the local accounting results (before tax) of that subsidiary for the relevant calendar year are included in the valuation. The results of each controlled subsidiary must be included on a stand-alone basis. These foreign profits are calculated according to the laws of the jurisdiction where the controlled foreign company or permanent establishment is located and are then converted into BRL, using the foreign exchange rate at balance sheet date of the foreign company.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, significant changes were introduced in respect of affiliated companies. Previous to Law 12,973/2014, affiliated companies were automatically subject to taxation under general CFC rules. Under the new CFC rules, affiliated companies are in principle not subject to the automatic taxation in Brazil. Profits of foreign affiliated companies are considered distributed to the parent company (and thus subject to taxation) only when credited or paid as specified in Law 12,973/2014. However, this rule only applies if the affiliated company:</p>

               <p>In case one of the conditions listed above is not met, the same rules applicable to the controlled foreign entities apply.</p>
               <p>Law 13,259/2016 states that resident companies may opt to submit the profits of affiliated companies abroad to the regime applicable to profits of controlled companies abroad. The law also indicates that the tax authorities will establish the form and conditions for this option.</p>

               <p>The Brazilian parent company may elect to pay the corporate income tax in relation to the CFC rules annually on a lump-sum basis or in instalments to be paid within 8 years – the first instalment must be equivalent to 12.5% of the tax due.

               <title>Compatibility of Brazilian CFC rules and tax treaties</title>
               <p>Several Brazilian scholars defend that Brazilian CFC rules are not in line with the provisions of article 7 of the OECD Model. Such article would prevent the taxation of business profits by a state other than the residence state, provided that there is no permanent establishment. Moreover, the Brazilian tax code establishes that tax treaties revoke or modify the internal law; therefore, they should always prevail in case of conflict.</p>
               <p>Brazilian tax authorities have adopted a different position. Private Ruling COSIT 18/2013 reflects the tax authorities’ view supporting the consistency of CFC legislation with the provisions of the tax treaties subscribed by Brazil. However, the subject is still open for discussion at judicial and administrative courts. On 24 April 2014, the Superior Court of Justice decided on a leading case (<emph type="i">Companhia Vale do Rio Doce v. Federal Union</emph>) regarding the application of Brazilian CFC legislation when the controlled company is resident in a treaty jurisdiction. The decision stated that the business profit article in tax treaties signed by Brazil prevents the application of Brazilian CFC legislation. As a result, the Court decided in favour of the taxpayer and denied the application of Brazilian CFC legislation to its controlled foreign companies located in Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg. The CFC legislation was considered applicable to the controlled foreign company located in Bermuda, as no tax treaty exists with Brazil.</p>
               <p>Law 12,973/2014, which amended the Brazilian CFC rules, has no major impact on the discussions, as the basic concept of taxation of undistributed profits of a subsidiary abroad remains in the new rules.</p>
               <p>On 21 October 2014, the Federal Administrative Court (<emph type="i">Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais,</emph> CARF) decided on a case concerning the compatibility of Brazilian CFC rules and tax treaties. The Court ruled that the Brazilian CFC rules conflict with tax treaties in respect of income tax, but not in respect of the Social Contribution on Net Profits (<emph type="i">Contribuição Social Sobre o Lucro Líquido</emph>, CSLL) when this contribution is not listed in the treaty. In addition, the Court decided that the CFC rules do not apply to foreign affiliated companies located in a country that is not a low-tax jurisdiction, since according to the STF's decision in the above-mentioned Case 2,588 (<emph type="i">see</emph> BR: SFC, 10 Apr. 2013, 2,588, Case Law IBFD), foreign affiliated companies located outside low-tax jurisdictions are not subject to CFC rules. The CARF has since then decided in other administrative cases that the taxation in Brazil according to CFC rules is not prevented by tax treaties (e.g. the <emph type="i">Belgravia</emph> case (decision 9101-003.617, of 6 June 2018); the <emph type="i">Centaurus</emph> case (decision 9101-003.616, of 6 June 2018); the <emph type="i">Petróleo</emph> <emph type="i">Brasileiro</emph> case (decision 9101-003.973, of 17 January 2019); the <emph type="i">Ball</emph> <emph type="i">Beverage</emph> case (decision 9101-004.583, of 4 December 2019) and the <emph type="i">Votorantim</emph> case (decision 1302-004.272, of 22 January 2020)).</p>

            <p>Brazil has other anti-avoidance rules implemented – <emph type="i">see</emph> subsections below.</p>
            <p>On 1 July 2021 and 8 October 2021, Brazil signed joint statements with other Inclusive Framework members with an agreement to implement a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. The solution includes a plan to ensure that large multinational enterprises (with revenues above EUR 750 million) pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each of the jurisdictions where they operate (Pillar Two). A key component of this plan is the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules, which provide for a co-ordinated system of taxation that imposes a top-up tax on profits arising in a jurisdiction whenever the effective tax rate is below the minimum rate of 15%.</p>

               <title>Low-tax jurisdictions</title>
               <p>Law 9,430/1996 introduced the concept of low-tax jurisdiction in the Brazilian legal framework. Article 24 of Law 9,430/1996, established that transactions performed between Brazilian individuals or corporate taxpayers with parties residing in a low-tax jurisdiction must be subject to the transfer pricing rules. For these purposes (i.e. transfer pricing rules), a low-tax jurisdiction was defined by article 24 as a country that does not tax income or that taxes income at a maximum tax rate lower than 20% (17% for countries following international fiscal transparency standards).</p>
               <p>Since then, several legal provisions in Brazil have dealt with the concept of low-tax jurisdiction for the purpose of application of the special tax treatment for outbound payments to residents in such jurisdictions.</p>
               <p>Some of these legal provisions make an express reference to article 24 of Law 9,430/1996 in order to define a low-tax jurisdiction (in such cases the definition of low-tax jurisdictions for the special tax treatment follows the definition stated by article 24 for transfer pricing rules), whereas other legal provisions make no reference to article 24, but have an autonomous definition of low-tax jurisdiction. This autonomous definition, however, coincides with the definition given in article 24 (above definition). This has an impact in practice, as several amendments were made to article 24 in the following years.</p>
               <p>Such amendments (described below) are applicable not only for the purpose of transfer pricing rules but also in other cases for the purpose of the special tax treatment which law indicates article 24 for the purpose of the definition of low-tax jurisdiction. Those amendments are not, however, taken into account for the purpose of the definition of low-tax jurisdiction, other laws that have their autonomous definition (i.e. a low-tax jurisdiction remains, for those cases, a country that does not tax income or that taxes income at a maximum tax rate lower than 20% (17% for countries following international fiscal transparency standards).</p>
               <p>The amendments of article 24, applicable to transfer pricing rules and certain special tax treatments, made significant changes to the concept of low-tax jurisdiction for those purposes.</p>
               <p>First, in 2002, the concept of low-tax jurisdiction in article 24 was slightly amended via Law 10,451/2002, in order to encompass the jurisdictions that oppose access to the disclosure of a shareholding composition and ownership of assets and rights.</p>
               <p>Law 11,727/2008 amended again the concept of low-tax jurisdictions in article 24 and, in addition, introduced new articles that created the concept of “privileged tax regimes”. These changes have been in force since 1 January 2009.</p>
               <p>Under the amendment to the concept of low-tax jurisdiction, a paragraph was introduced in article 24 to state that a jurisdiction or territory that does not “grant access to information related to composition of shareholders of legal entities, title or beneficial owner of earnings attributed to non-residents” is considered to be a low-tax jurisdiction (introduced by Law 11,727/2008, referring to the inclusion of paragraph 4 in article 24 of Law 9,430).</p>
               <p>The concept of “privileged tax regime” was created by an inclusion of articles 24-A and 24-B in Law 9,430/1996. This concept was created for purpose of classifying new transactions that would be subject to transfer pricing rules. As this was not an amendment to article 24, but an inclusion of new articles, legally the concept of “privilege tax regime” is not applicable for the purpose of the tax treatment of outbound payments to residents in low-tax jurisdictions which law makes reference to article 24, but only for transfer pricing purposes.</p>
               <p>Under the new article 24-A, a “privileged tax regime” is one that:</p>

As a result, tax authorities are allowed to examine taxpayers' information in documents, books and registries of financial institutions (including information on deposit accounts and financial investments). </p>

               <p>Normative Instruction 1,037/2010 has not been revised to reflect the new income tax threshold standard (17%) established by Ordinance 488/2014.</p>
               <p>According to an Administrative Act issued by the Brazilian tax authorities on 25 March 2011, Luxembourg holding companies are no longer considered to be a privileged tax regime, as the regime has lapsed and its transitory period is terminated.</p>
               <p>On 20 June 2014, Normative Ruling 1,474/2014 included in the list of privileged tax regimes the Swiss regimes that are applicable to legal entities incorporated as a holding company, domiciliary company, auxiliary company, mixed company and administrative company, whose tax treatment result in the imposition of corporate income tax at a rate lower than 20%, as provided for by the federal, cantonal and municipal legislation. </p>
               <p>Moreover, Normative Ruling 1,474/2014 has also listed as privileged tax regime any Swiss tax regime applicable to other types of legal entities by means of the issuance of rulings by the tax authorities, which results in the levy of the corporate income tax at a rate lower than 20% as provided for by the federal, cantonal and municipal legislation.</p>
               <p>Jurisdictions listed as low-tax jurisdictions or privileged tax regimes may request a revision of their characterization as low-tax jurisdictions or privileged tax regime (Administrative Rule 1,045, which was enacted in 23 June 2010 and changed some provisions of Administrative Rule 1,037/2010). There may be a suspension of the listing with regard to a certain jurisdiction, at the discretion of the federal Revenue Service Secretary, while the request is being considered.</p>
               <p>On 25 June 2010, the Federal Revenue Service published Normative Acts 10 and 11, stating that Switzerland and the Netherlands have filed requests for review. During the analysis of the requests, suspensions have been granted in respect of the two countries. On 18 December 2015, tax authorities issued Normative Act 3/2015, which revoked Normative Act 10 and reintroduced the regime applicable to Dutch holding companies not developing substantial economic activity within the list of privileged tax regimes. On 31 December 2019, the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_carf">CARF</xref> issued a decision in Administrative Procedure 16561.720100/2017-97 (<emph type="i">Unilever Brasil Ltda</emph>.) on the interpretation and application of the “substantial economic activity” requirement for the purpose of characterizing Dutch holding companies as entities subject to a privileged tax regime under Brazilian tax legislation. The CARF concluded that the taxpayer had not demonstrated that the foreign-related entity had factual economic substance in the Netherlands and, therefore, decided in favour of the National Treasury. In addition, the evidence that the Dutch holding company had premises in the Netherlands and other loan contracts signed with entities in China and Sweden was not sufficient to demonstrate substantial economic activity in the Netherlands. One dissident councillor indicated, however, that the rule considering the Dutch regime applicable to holding companies not developing substantial economic activity as a privileged tax regime was suspended in the year of the assessment (2012) and that its reintroduction in 2015 could not have retroactive effects.</p>
               <p>A request for review was also presented by Spain and suspension was granted through Normative Act 22, published on 2 December 2010, regarding the regime applicable to companies incorporated as Spanish foreign participation holding companies (ETVEs).</p>
               <p>On 20 June 2014, the Federal Revenue Service published Normative Instruction 1,474/2014, providing that Switzerland is no longer considered a low-tax jurisdiction. However, certain Swiss tax regimes were qualified as privileged tax regimes. Normative Instruction 1,474/2014 also removed the Hungarian KFT regime from the privileged tax regime list. These changes apply retroactively from 1 January 2014.</p>
               <p>In general, the following measures are applicable in respect of payments to or transactions carried on with persons located in low-tax jurisdictions or deemed as benefiting from privileged tax regimes:</p>

However, this was a correction due to a duplication in the list, where both Saint Kitts and Nevis and its Portuguese translation <emph type="i">Federação de São Cristóvão e Nevis</emph> appeared. Therefore, Saint Kitts and Nevis remain as a low-tax jurisdiction, since <emph type="i">Federação de São Cristóvão e Nevis</emph> was not removed from the list; and (iii) Austrian holding companies are qualified as benefiting from privileged tax regimes. </p>
               <p>Furthermore, regarding Danish and Dutch holding companies, Normative Instruction 1,658/2016 clarified that having "substantial economic activity" means that a company has appropriated operational capacity for its purposes, as evidenced, among others factors, by means of having at its disposal (i) a sufficient number of employees to develop its activities and (ii) the physical facilities for the exercise of its management and decisions related to (a) the development of activities in order to get income derived from its assets and (b) the administration of equity interest in order to get income arising from the distribution of profit and capital gain.</p>
               <p>The concept of an “undertaxation” regime <emph type="i">(regime de subtributação</emph>) also exists, but only for the purpose of application of specific CFC rules – i.e. requirements for consolidation of the results (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_7.2.2.">7.2.2.</xref>) and for application of the CFC rules to affiliated companies (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_10.4.">10.4.</xref>). The concept of an “undertaxation” regime is similar to low tax jurisdictions except for the fact that undertaxation regimes are considered to be those with a nominal income tax rate lower than 20%. According to Normative Instruction 1,674/2016, which amended Normative Instruction 1,520, low tax jurisdictions and privileged tax regimes are included in the concept of undertaxation regime.</p>

However, the Brazilian tax authorities have attempted to tax indirect transfer of assets in two cases (Administrative Proceedings 19515.003180/2005-22 and 16682.720343/2013­25), on the basis of anti-avoidance rules.

            <p>Brazil has more than one value added tax. The tax on manufactured products (<xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref>) is levied at federal level on every stage of the production process and on import transactions. In addition, the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_icms">ICMS</xref> is levied at the state level.</p>
            <p>This section deals with the IPI. For the ICMS, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.1.">14.6.4.1.</xref> </p>
            <p>The IPI is provided for by article 153 (IV, 3º) of the 1988 Federal Constitution and currently regulated by IPI Law 4,502/1964, as amended, and IPI Regulations enacted by Decree 7,212/2010 and Decree 8,950/2016.</p>
            <p>IPI is a federal tax imposed on the supply and importation of any type of manufactured product or good. The imposition of IPI respects the non-cumulative principle, under which the tax considered due in prior transactions (including import of products) may be offset against the tax due on subsequent transactions involving the product manufactured by the taxpayer.</p>
            <p>Part of the revenue from IPI is shared by the states and the municipalities.</p>

            <p>Article 51 of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ctn">CTN</xref> defines a taxable person as anyone who imports and/or manufactures goods, or to whom the federal legislation applies equivalent treatment.</p>

               <title>General</title>
               <p>Taxable persons are those who import and/or manufacture goods, or to whom the federal legislation applies equivalent treatment. Suppliers and dealers of goods seized or abandoned and taken to auction are also taxable persons for the purposes of <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref>.</p>
               <p>Under the legal definition, a person is liable to remit IPI whenever there is an import and industrialization of goods, regardless of the legal status of the entity – an exception applies if the person has tax immunity or the goods are exempt from tax, but a written consent of the tax authorities may be needed in this respect.</p>
               <p>As a main rule, private individuals are not considered to be taxable persons for the purposes of IPI.</p>
               <p>According to precedents set by the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_stf">STF</xref>, products imported by non-taxable legal entities (i.e. service providers) or private individuals (for personal use) are not subject to IPI.</p>

In this respect, related parties are those with which a company has been able to trade in the broadest sense of the term, in conditions that are not reciprocal and do not have the independence that characterizes transactions with third parties outside the company, its management control or any other area of influence in its decisions.</p>

               <p>The difference between the actual performance of manufacturing activities (subject to IPI) and the rendering of services (subject to the ISS) is based on the destination or use given to the product; if the product is for the personal use or consumption of the contractor or is included in his enterprise’s fixed assets, the actual manufacturing would be deemed an actual service, therefore subject to the municipal ISS. However, if the product is destined for sale or to be applied to other products to be manufactured, the transaction will be considered effective industrialization by the manufacturer, therefore subject to IPI.</p>

            <title>Rates</title>
            <p> IPI rates vary in accordance with the relevant product, based on the tax classification code provided for under the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref> Regulations. The tax classification code is based on the Explanatory Notes of the Harmonized System (NESH) and the External Common Tariff (TEC).</p>
            <p>Rates may vary inversely with the necessity of the product (from 365% to nil) and are subject to frequent amendments; thus, superfluous goods (e.g. manufactured tobacco, alcoholic beverages) are subject to high rates while certain semi-manufactured products attract very low rates – some goods are subject to a specific charge of IPI, i.e. a fixed sum imposed on each article of a determined class. A nil rate, in general, is applicable only to essential products. However, this essentiality will depend on the current moment of the Brazilian economy, to the extent that the government may decide to reduce the IPI rate (or even increase, with regard to import transactions) in order to stimulate a determined sector of the economy. The IPI is one of the few taxes under the Brazilian legal system, such that changes in rates do not require the enactment of a new law. Effectively, up to certain limits specified by law, the IPI rates may be freely established by the executive branch, via decree, with immediate effect.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the IPI is often used as a tool to allow the intervention of the government in specific areas of the economy, either by reducing rates to stimulate the local production and domestic market of a determined product or by increasing rates, mainly in connection with import transactions, in order to enhance the competitiveness of Brazilian products.</p>
            <p>In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government reduced IPI rates for various items (e.g. plastic, chemicals, food and vegetables).</p>

            <p>
               <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_ipi">IPI</xref> is charged at each stage of the manufacturing process of products. As in the case of VAT, products that pass through several manufacturing stages (e.g. from raw material to finished goods) are allowed offsetting adjustments to compensate for the IPI paid on each separate transaction. When the production phase is concluded, IPI is no longer imposed and the accumulated financial burden is usually incorporated into the final cost of the product.</p>
            <p>Tax paid (input IPI) on raw material, intermediary products and packing material may be offset against the tax liability, provided that such materials or products are used in the production of taxable goods.</p>
            <p>Purchases of goods that do not form part of new products but are used in the production of taxable goods may also give rise to an input IPI. This group includes tools that are subject to depreciation or are damaged due to physical contact with the articles which are being produced.</p>
            <p>A credit (input IPI) is also granted on specific machinery and equipment produced in Brazil forming part of fixed assets and used solely in the manufacturing process. The eligible items are listed by the Ministry of Finance. The Coordinator of the Tax System declared that purchases of Brazilian-made machinery and equipment connected with industrial development and mining projects approved by the government are entitled to input IPI even if the machinery or equipment in question are not included in the Ministry of Finance’s list. The Supreme Court has ruled that the credit available to the domestic purchaser of Brazilian-made machinery to be used as his enterprise’s fixed assets is a subsidy to the national industry and therefore not applicable to foreign products.</p>
            <p>Manufacturers may consider input IPI the tax paid on raw material, intermediary products and packing material purchased from wholesalers that are not taxpayers for IPI purposes. The input IPI is calculated by applying the rate pertaining to the product in question to 50% of its price.</p>

               <p>Federal customs duties are levied either on a specific or an <emph type="i">ad valorem</emph> basis, depending on the nature of the goods imported. Tables of classifications of goods subject to customs duties and customs tariffs are established by a decree that must be published in the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_dou">DOU</xref>.</p>
               <p>The Customs Tariff Law of 1957 (Law 3,244/1957, as amended) specifies whether the tariff base of a specified import is “specific” or “<emph type="i">ad valorem</emph>” and the authorities may charge on either the <emph type="i">ad valorem</emph> or the specific basis, or both, depending on the circumstances of the importation and which rate results in a greater duty.</p>
               <p>The taxable value of imported goods is their c.i.f. (cost, insurance and freight) value and is the normal “open market” price of the goods in question or of similar goods at the time of importation. The price shown on the invoice is generally accepted as the normal price. However, about 10% of total imports are valued according to either minimum value or base price criteria.</p>
               <p>An exemption applies to goods up to USD 1,000 purchased for personal use or consumption by travellers arriving by air or sea or USD 500 if arriving by land, river or lake (Ordinance 440/2010 as amended) – quantitative limits may apply for certain goods. For purchases made by travellers at duty-free shops in ports or airports, the exemption applies to goods up to an amount of USD 500 in accordance with Ordinance 307/2014 as amended.</p>

                     <p>Transactions involving diesel, biodiesel, gasoline, anhydrous ethanol and liquefied petroleum gas are subject to ICMS only once (<emph type="i">incidência única</emph>), at uniform rates for all states. According to Complementary Law 192/2022, producers and importers of fuels are ICMS taxpayers. The taxable event for ICMS purposes will be considered to have occurred at the time of importation (when from abroad) and upon the departure of the fuels from the taxpayer's establishment (when local).</p>
                     <p>There are other transactions which are deemed not to be taxable events for ICMS purposes or which are not subject to ICMS under precedents issued by Brazilian courts. In this regard, on 12 September 2014, the Supreme Federal Court confirmed that ICMS is not levied on the import of goods under leasing arrangements.</p>
                     <p>As from 1 April 2018, federal states were authorized by State Agreement 106/2017 (<emph type="i">Convênio</emph> ICMS 106/2017) to charge ICMS at the special rate of 5% on standardized digital goods such as packaged software, games, apps and electronic files that are sold to or imported by final consumers and delivered through electronic means (e.g. software downloading, streaming and cloud computing). The taxpayer is the owner of the website or electronic platform by means of which the transaction is made and the tax is collected by the state in which the buyer is located. States may transfer the responsibility of collecting the tax to the financial intermediate (e.g. credit card administrator) or to the final consumer in case the taxpayer is not registered in that state. In import transactions, the collection of the tax must be made by the credit or debit card administrator or the financial company that is a foreign exchange intermediate.</p>
                     <p>However, states and municipalities have been disputing the taxation of digital transactions, since ISS is levied by municipalities on the provision of services (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.2.">14.6.4.2.</xref>). and ICMS is levied by states on the sale of goods, but these two taxes are mutually exclusive (they cannot be levied on the same transaction). In addition, digital transactions cannot be easily qualified as service or sale of goods according to Brazilian legislation and case law, which causes uncertainty in respect of which tax should be levied. As a consequence, the constitutionality of State Agreement 106/2017 (that authorizes federal states to levy ICMS on digital goods) was being discussed under lawsuit ADI 5,958 at the Federal Supreme Court. However, this lawsuit was closed without judgment in view of the decision given by that Court in ADI 1,945 and 5,659 in the sense that ICMS cannot be levied on the download of software and electronic transfer of data since ISS is already charged on software licensing (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.2.">14.6.4.2.</xref>).</p>

                     <p>An increased rate of 25% applies to the supply or importation of certain luxury goods (e.g. weapons, ammunition, manufactured tobacco, perfumes, cosmetics, jewels, alcoholic beverages, imported cars, motorcycles with engine capacity exceeding 250 cc, furs).</p>
                     <p>Transactions involving diesel, biodiesel, gasoline, anhydrous ethanol and liquefied petroleum gas are subject to a uniform rate for all states to be defined by the National Council of Fiscal Policy (<emph type="i">Conselho Nacional de Política Fazendária</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_confaz">CONFAZ</xref>), which brings together representatives of the states.</p>
                     <p>The Brazilian Senate issued Resolution 13/2012 which unified the ICMS rate applicable to interstate transactions involving imported goods. Accordingly, since 1 January 2013, the 7% or 12% rates generally applicable to interstate transactions are replaced by the single rate of 4%. The single 4% rate applies to: (i) simple resale of goods after their import (i.e. without going through any industrial process) and (ii) goods subject to any manufacturing process resulting in other goods or merchandise with over 40% of imported content (such percentage is based on the ratio between the prices of the imported products and the value of the interstate transaction).</p>
                     <p>The interstate sale of goods to final consumers was subject to ICMS in the state of origin at the applicable internal rate. However, with effect from 1 January 2016, the ICMS levied on those cases is shared between the state of origin and the state of destination as follows (Constitutional Amendment 87/2015 and States Agreement 93/2015): </p>

                     <p>However, under the Constitution, only a federal complementary law can establish ICMS general rules. In this context, lawsuits were filed to challenge the constitutionality of States Agreement 93/2015 on the grounds that the DIFAL could not be charged prior to the enactment of a federal complementary law. In 2021, the Federal Supreme Court upheld the understanding that States Agreement 93/2015 is unconstitutional, but determined that such a decision should only produce effects as of 2022 in order to provide the Congress with sufficient time to enact a new Complementary Law until the end of 2021. In December 2021, the Congress finally approved Complementary Law 190 regulating the DIFAL charged on interstate sales to final consumers, but the President only signed and published the Law on 4 January 2022. As a result, a new judicial battle has been initiated by taxpayers aimed at having the courts declare that Complementary Law 190/2022 can only be applied as of 2023 in view of the annual principle (i.e. the requirement that a law establishing a new tax or an increase in taxes cannot produce effects in the same calendar year in which it is published) and, therefore, that the DIFAL cannot be charged on sales to final consumers prior to that date. A decision from the Federal Supreme Court on this is pending.</p>

                     <p>Under specific agreements between the states of the Brazilian Federation (<emph type="i">convênios</emph>), in the scope of the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_confaz">CONFAZ</xref>, states may grant ICMS exemptions, reductions of the taxable base, estimated credits and other tax benefits.</p>
                     <p>Nonetheless, over the years, several Brazilian states have granted tax exemptions and reductions without express authorizations from the CONFAZ. As a general rule, these exemptions were granted as tools to attract more business to the states, creating a major issue of harmful tax competition between the Brazilian states. This matter is currently under the spotlight of the Brazilian authorities, and states have been filing lawsuits questioning the legality of the tax incentives granted by other states without the express approval of CONFAZ. The Supreme Court of Justice has already issued decisions recognizing that the state benefits granted without the approval of CONFAZ are unconstitutional and, therefore, invalid. However, the matter is still not fully resolved, and other related issues have surfaced in situations where the benefits are deemed unconstitutional, such as whether or not the state is obliged to claim the unpaid taxes from the taxpayers.</p>
                     <p>Complementary Law 160/2017, published in the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_dou">DOU</xref> of 8 August 2017, was enacted to modify the rules on authorization of tax benefits by the CONFAZ. Previously, ICMS tax benefits could only be granted with the unanimous approval of the CONFAZ. According to Law 160/2017, the current quorum requirement is of at least: (i) two thirds of all the federal states; and (ii) one third of the federal states of each of the five regions.</p>
                     <p>The creation of new tax incentives and the extension of existing ones must respect the new limits imposed by the law for the duration of the incentives – varying from 1 to 15 years depending on the industry.</p>
                     <p>In addition, Complementary Law 160/2017 also determined that the CONFAZ has 180 days from the date of publication of the law to validate all state incentives which are in force. States are also allowed to implement, without requiring approval from CONFAZ, the same incentives introduced by neighbour states in the same region.</p>

                     <p>In computing the tax liability, input tax may be credited against output tax, so that in practice only the value added to the taxpayer’s supplies is taxed (this is referred to in Brazil as the non-cumulative principle).</p>

Under the Federal Constitution, unless otherwise provided (i.e. for exports), exempt and non-taxed transactions do not give rise to a credit to be set off against output ICMS.

                  <title>Municipal tax on services </title>
                  <p>The <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_iss">ISS</xref> applies to services of any nature, except for communication services and intermunicipal and interstate transportation services, which are subject to <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_icms">ICMS</xref>.</p>
                  <p>ISS is provided by article 156 (III, 3º) of the 1988 Federal Constitution (as redrafted under the 3rd Constitutional Amendment of 1993) and currently regulated by Complementary Law 116/2003.</p>
                  <p>Municipalities may levy taxes on the supply of services (other than the mentioned services subject to ICMS) listed in the Annex of Complementary Law 116/2003. The import of the listed services (i.e. the rendering of services by a non-resident service provider to a client in Brazil) is also subject to ISS. In the case of import of service, the taxpayer is the non-resident person providing the service. However, Complementary Law 116/2003 allows municipalities to determine by municipal law that another person is responsible for the payment of the tax. In addition, the law also indicates that regardless of this rule, in the case of import of service, the service taker in Brazil is also responsible for the payment of ISS. This leads to discussions on who is the actual taxpayer of ISS in the case of import of service and whether this tax is actually a burden on the service taker (as an extra cost in addition to the payment of the service) or the service provider (as withholding tax). This uncertainty may be resolved by municipalities by means of determining who the taxpayer is under municipal law and clarifying how the tax is to be collected. However, many municipalities have not yet issued laws in this respect.</p>
                  <p>The export of services is exempt from ISS, except if the service is executed in Brazil and the "result" is verified in Brazil – even if the payment of the service fee is made by a non-resident person. In this exceptional case, ISS is due. There is controversy in respect of what “result” means for the purpose of this rule, which can lead to discussions on the application of the exemption.</p>
                  <p>As a rule, services are subject to tax in the municipality where the supplier’s establishment is located (certain services are however subject to a different rule – <emph type="i">see further</emph> below). In the case where there is no such establishment, the place of supply is deemed to be the residence of the supplier. Some services are however subject to special rules (e.g. construction works are taxed in the municipality where the services are provided). Complementary Law 157/2016, published in the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_dou">DOU</xref> of 1 June 2017, added other services (i.e. health insurance services, administration of credit and debit cards, leasing, franchising and factoring) to the exceptions and determined that such services are taxed by the municipality in which the client (“service taker”) is located. However, on 23 March 2018, the Federal Supreme Court suspended this amendment in view of the conflicts of jurisdiction between municipalities, which defies the constitutional principle of legal certainty. According to the court, this change requires the concept of “service taker” to be specified in order to avoid serious legal uncertainty and possible double taxation.</p>
                  <p>Complementary Law 157/2016 also included in the list of services subject to ISS the act of making available audio, video, image or text content through the Internet. The fact that states were also authorized to levy ICMS on digital transactions triggered discussions on the topic (for details, <emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_14.6.4.1.3.">14.6.4.1.3.</xref>). </p>
                  <p>On 4 November 2020, the Federal Supreme Court ruled that only ISS could be levied on software licensing (Direct Actions for Unconstitutionality ADI 5,659 and ADI 1,945). The reporter of the case concluded that, according to the traditional understanding of the Supreme Court, the simple fact that software licensing is included in the list of services attached to Complementary Law 116/03 means that the total value of the transaction is subject to ISS, which prevents ICMS from being levied thereon.</p>
                  <p>On 24 September 2020, Complementary Law 175/2020 determined that, for the following services, the ISS is due to the municipality where the customer is located: health assistance plans, veterinary assistance plans, fund management, consortia (similar to financial services for the acquisition of assets and real estate), credit and debit cards and leasing. In addition, the amount of ISS collected will be split between the municipality where the service provider is located and the municipality where the customer is located. In order to provide legal certainty to municipalities, these new rules will be implemented gradually. It is envisaged that, as from 2023, 100% of ISS due will be collected by the municipality where the customer is located.</p>
                  <p>ISS is levied on industrial, commercial or professional service supplies. Services combined with a supply of goods (e.g. repair shops, the operation of hotels and restaurants) are also subject to ISS. As a rule, even if the services involve a supply of goods, the ISS applies only to the portion of the transaction related to the rendering of the listed services (i.e. the price of goods and materials is excluded from the ISS taxable base). On 8 June 2020, the Federal Supreme Court considered the levy of ISS on franchise agreements to be constitutional.</p>
                  <p>ISS is normally calculated on the fees paid for the service. Certain deductions related to materials supplied by the service provider are allowed. The ISS rate varies from 2% to 5% in view of the type of service and the relevant municipality.</p>

                  <p>The tax on financial transactions (<emph type="i">imposto sobre operações financeiras</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_iof">IOF</xref>) is a federal tax currently levied mainly on currency exchange, credit, securities and insurance transactions. The IOF is not subject to the legality principle, which means that the executive branch may change the IOF tax rate at any time, provided that the rate does not exceed 25%.</p>
                  <p>Companies are required to specify on invoices and receipts the taxes charged (percentages) on the sale of goods or the provision of services, including IOF. In this sense, companies must list the amount of municipal, state and federal taxes levied for each product described in the invoices and receipts. Alternatively, such information could also be displayed on a panel in plain view within their establishments. Companies failing to comply with these requirements are subject to administrative penalties.</p>
                  <p>The IOF is currently regulated by Decree 6,306/2007, as amended, and Normative Ruling 1,969/2020.</p>

                     <p>Currency exchange transactions undertaken with regard to inflows of funds to Brazil and the outflows of funds from Brazil are subject to IOF at a general 0.38% rate. The IOF is levied on the amount in BRL received or paid in the transaction.</p>
                     <p>The Brazilian federal government is allowed to increase the IOF rate up to 25% at any time. However, any increase in rates only applies to future transactions. Some transactions benefit from a 0% rate while other transactions have more burdensome taxation, based on the imposition of a 2% or 6% rate.</p>
                     <p>In view of the discussions on the accession to the OECD, Brazil committed to eliminate the IOF on currency exchange transactions by 2029.

                     <p>Currently, loan transactions granted by legal entities are subject to a daily rate of 0.0041% (if the debtor is a legal entity) or 0.0082% (if the debtor is an individual), plus an additional 0.38%, which is calculated on the principal amount of the loan. A special daily rate of 0.00137% applies in the case the debtor is a legal entity qualified for the simplified regime (<emph type="i">Simples Nacional</emph>). With regard to transactions with a predetermined principal amount, the imposition of the daily rate is limited to 365 days. Other specific rules apply for the imposition of the IOF on credit transactions where the principal amount is not determined and on insurance and securities transactions. </p>
                     <p>However, the IOF daily rates levied on credit transactions occurring between 20 September 2021 and 31 December 2021 are increased as follows (the 0.38% rate remains unchanged):</p>

                     <p>The contribution for intervention on the economic domain (<emph type="i">Contribuição de Intervenção no Domínio Econômico</emph>, <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cide">CIDE</xref>) applies to taxable events occurring on or after 1 January 2001. This contribution is intended to finance the Programme to Stimulate the Interaction of University-Corporations for the Support of Innovation (<emph type="i">Programa de Estímulo à Interação Universidade-Empresa para Apoio à Inovação</emph>).</p>
                     <p>Royalties paid by resident entities to non-resident persons as consideration for the transfer of technology, including trademarks, patents and the provision of technology, as well as payments for the provision of technical service and assistance, are subject to the contribution at a rate of 10% of the gross amount. On 11 September 2018, the <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_carf">CARF</xref> issued Binding Decision 127 (<emph type="i">Súmula Carf</emph> 127) confirming that CIDE must be levied on the import of technical services regardless of whether there is a transfer of technology.</p>
                     <p>The CIDE taxpayer is the Brazilian company that benefits from the exploitation of the underlying right in Brazil or the beneficiary of the technical services or technical assistance, as the case may be. This means that CIDE is due and payable by the Brazilian licensee and beneficiary of services and thus it is not withheld from the amount of the royalties or service fees to be paid to the non-resident beneficiary. According to Binding Decision 158 (<emph type="i">Súmula</emph> 158), the withholding tax levied on outbound payments is included in the taxable base of CIDE contribution even if the paying source in Brazil bears the financial burden of the withholding tax.</p>
                     <p>The CIDE contribution is not imposed on cross-border payments for software licences, except for payments involving the acquisition of software rights (including transfer of technology/source code).</p>
                     <p>According to Private Ruling 99/2018, CIDE’s taxable base is the net revenue paid to the non-resident person plus the withholding tax levied, regardless of who assumed the economic burden of this withholding tax (the Brazilian source of the non-resident).</p>
                     <p>In certain circumstances, the CIDE contribution rate is reduced to zero per cent if the company paying the patent or trademark royalties of the service fees benefits from tax incentives targeting certain technology activities (e.g. semiconductors, digital TV).</p>

                     <p>For a long period, the CIDE-Fuel was levied at a 0% rate. However, Decree 8,395/2015 reintroduced the CIDE-Fuel charge with effect from 1 May 2015. The CIDE-Fuel is imposed per cubic meter of gasoline and diesel imported or sold. The CIDE-Fuel rates for aviation kerosene (and other kerosene), fuel oils, liquefied petroleum gas (including natural gas and naphtha derived) and ethanol, however, remain at 0%.</p>

                  <title>Proposals for the taxation of digitalized economy</title>
                  <p>Brazil is currently discussing different proposals for taxation of the digitalized economy – <emph type="i">see</emph> the proposals further below.</p>
                  <p>The United States had initially opened investigations into Brazil concerning the taxation of digitalized economy but decided to terminate them based on the finding that the taxes are not yet implemented. However, the United States informed that new investigations may be initiated if Brazil proceeds to adopt the proposed taxes.</p>
                  <p>On 1 July 2021 and 8 October 2021, Brazil signed joint statements with other Inclusive Framework members with an agreement to implement a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy, which includes key elements on the allocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions (Pillar One) (<emph type="i">see</emph> section <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_s_7.3.1.">7.3.1.</xref>). A multilateral convention with the requirement for parties to remove all digital service taxes and other relevant similar measures is expected to be signed – a detailed definition of what constitutes relevant similar measures will be included in the convention. This means that the proposals below may be affected.</p>
                  <p>The joint statement signed on 8 October 2021 also states that no newly enacted unilateral measures will be imposed from 8 October 2021 and until the earlier of 31 December 2023 or the coming into force of the expected multilateral convention.</p>

                     <p>The payment of CIDE-Digital is due by the last business day of the month of March of the year following that in which the taxable event takes place.</p>
                     <p>In its justification section, the Bill refers to the OECD/G20 BEPS Project and the need for unilateral measures to address the lack of taxation of the digital economy until a global solution is agreed. It further indicates that the CIDE-Digital follows the concept of digital taxes proposed by the European Commission and implemented by countries like Italy and France. As CIDE-Digital has the nature of a contribution, the revenue generated therefrom will finance the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (<emph type="i">Fundo Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,</emph> FNDCT).</p>

                     <p>On 19 August 2020, a Complementary Bill (<emph type="i">Projeto de lei Complementar</emph>) was submitted to the National Congress with a proposal to create a contribution on digital services (<emph type="i">Contribuição Social sobre Serviços Digitais</emph>, CSSD) to be levied on gross revenue derived by resident and non-resident companies from digital services targeting the Brazilian market.</p>

                     <p>The CSSD collected would be applied to minimum income programmes implemented by the federal government.</p>

It further indicates that the CSSD follows the concept of digital taxes proposed by the European Commission and implemented by countries like France.</p>
                     <p>The justification also points out that the federal government considers that it is necessary to establish minimum income programmes in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and taxing the digital giants would contribute to finance such programmes.</p>

                     <title>CBS</title>
                     <p>A proposal to create a contribution on goods and services (<emph type="i">Contribuição sobre Bens e Serviços</emph> (CBS)) is currently under discussion at the National Congress. The proposal aims at unifying the existing <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_pis">PIS</xref> and <xref target="cta_br_2022-07-01_abb_cofins">COFINS</xref> into one contribution on goods and services. According to the proposal, legal entities providing services and selling goods, including non-resident entities in case of imports, would be subject to the CBS at the rate of 12% on gross revenue.</p>
                     <p>Under the proposal, digital platforms are defined as any legal entity that acts in a remote manner as intermediary between suppliers and buyers in transactions involving the sale of goods and services. Entities providing only one of the following activities are not considered digital platforms: (i) provision of Internet access; (ii) processing of payment; (iii) advertisement; or (iv) search for suppliers, as long as they do not charge the service based on the sales made.</p>
                     <p>The Bill justification indicates that it follows the recommendations of the OECD/G20 BEPS Project for market jurisdictions to adapt their systems to the digitalization of the economy. It refers to the principle of destination in Action 1 and explains that the Bill kept the taxation on imports and followed the guidelines on simplified registration for digital platforms and other service suppliers in Brazil.</p>

                     <title>COFINS-digital</title>
                     <p>A proposal to create COFINS-digital is currently under discussion at the National Congress. Under the proposal, the receipt of gross revenue by legal entities making use of digital platforms would be subject to the COFINS-digital at a 10.6% rate. Resident and non-resident legal entities would be subject to this contribution, provided they have a monthly gross revenue from digital services provided worldwide exceeding USD 20 million and in Brazil exceeding BRL 6.5 million.</p>
                     <p>The Bill justification refers to the OECD/G20 BEPS Project and its guiding principle of taxation where consumers are located, regardless of where the company is situated. It also refers to the digital service taxes implemented in France and Spain as examples to be followed.</p>
